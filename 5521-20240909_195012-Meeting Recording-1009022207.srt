1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,519
OK, uh, anyone got the result?

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,960
64, not correct.

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,320
So let's see how we can get the result to be 64.

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
OK, we can go back to the previous slide.

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,520
OK, at this part, right?

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:56,520
So we start from this row, 1 can be represented as 13.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:09,520
So 13 minus 3 times 4, and this 3, 13 minus 3 is minus 4 times

8
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,519
3 is some combination of 16 and 13.

9
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:26,519
16 minus 13, so this 5 times 13 minus 4 times 16.

10
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,519
OK, and this 13 can be represented as some combination

11
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:39,519
of 5 times 13 is 93 minus 5 times 16.

12
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:46,519
Minus 4 times 16, so this 5 times 93, 1.

13
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:55,519
This 25 minus 4, this is 29 times 16.

14
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:07,519
OK, we want to get modular inverse of 16, mod 93.

15
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,519
So both sides, we take mod 93, so this part is 0,

16
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:18,519
and this part, that means this is minus 29,

17
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,519
is modular inverse of 16.

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,520
So this is congruent to 93 minus 29.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,520
So this equals 64 mod 93.

20
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,520
So this is x value, right?

21
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:55,520
So 64 is the modular inverse of 15 mod 93.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,520
OK, any questions, comments?

23
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:22,520
So this result is 64.

24
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:30,520
OK, now we go to part 3.

25
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,520
So part 3, we'll study the prime numbers.

26
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,520
From prime numbers, we will learn the Fermat theorem,

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:04:00,520
and then we'll continue with the Euler's theorem.

28
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,520
No problem.

29
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,520
But prime numbers are those numbers with dividers of 1 and itself,

30
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,520
just like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.

31
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,519
All the numbers are called to be composite numbers, that's 4 and 6.

32
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,519
And we have the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

33
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:29,519
That means any integer to be bigger than 1 can be factored in a unique way,

34
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:40,519
as a equals p1 to the a1 times p2 to the a2 times pt to the at.

35
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,519
So p1 is more than p2, it's more than pt.

36
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,519
Those are the prime numbers, and where each ai is part integer,

37
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,519
so a1, a2 are at the exponent part.

38
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:06,519
For example, 24 can be factored as 2 to the 3 times 3 to the 1, right?

39
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:19,519
Two prime numbers to the exponent to be 3 and 1.

40
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:26,519
Okay, here we have all the primes under two solid four prime numbers.

41
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,519
It's hard to tell which one is a prime number or not.

42
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,519
Especially when the number is very large, how to test if the number is prime.

43
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:42,519
That's a challenge problem.

44
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,519
Now we look at the Fermat theorem.

45
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Fermat's theorem states that if p is prime and a is a part integer not divisible by p,

46
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:02,519
then we have a to the p mass 1 is congruent to 1 mod p.

47
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,519
So a is a part integer not divisible by p.

48
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,519
Suppose p is prime.

49
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:19,519
One example just like if p is prime number 7, so a equals 4 or 10.

50
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:31,519
So p is not a factor of a, so a is not divisible by p.

51
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:38,519
Just like in this example, a can be 4, a can be 10.

52
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:43,519
So p is not a factor of a.

53
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,519
Then we have this equation.

54
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:54,519
a to the p mass 1, if p mass 1 is, in this example is 6,

55
00:06:54,519 --> 00:07:03,519
so a is 4 to the 6 is congruent to 1 mod 7.

56
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:16,519
Or 10 to the 6 is congruent to 1 mod 7.

57
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,519
So this is our statement.

58
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:35,519
An applied form is, we'll add both sides with times a.

59
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:42,519
So the left-hand side is a to the p is congruent to a mod p.

60
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,519
That's mod p.

61
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,519
So this is the Fermat theorem.

62
00:07:49,519 --> 00:08:01,519
Here is the table to show that for any given the p to be 19, to be a prime number.

63
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:11,519
For any number a, a is from in this column, 1, 2, 3, 0, 18.

64
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:23,519
For the number a is smaller than p, of course, p is not a factor of a.

65
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:32,519
So if a is smaller than p, a is not divisible by p according to the Fermat theorem.

66
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:43,519
For the a to the p mass 1 is congruent to 1 mod p.

67
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:55,519
So if we look at the last column, so here is a to the 18 is congruent to 1 mod 19.

68
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:06,519
So the last column, no matter what the value of a, y, j, h, t, the last column for the value to be 1.

69
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,519
So this is the Fermat theorem.

70
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,519
To tell you, this is the rule of this problem you can find.

71
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:33,519
So we need to understand how we can prove it because this proposal is quite critical for us to understand the modular operation.

72
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:46,519
In this statement, in Fermat's theorem, if p is prime and a is a positive integer not divisible by p, so we have this equation.

73
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:54,519
The proof process is quite interesting, so I would like to share it with you.

74
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,519
Suppose we have a set to prove it, we can construct some sets.

75
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:10,519
So set A with all members 1, 2, 3, till p mass 1.

76
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:19,519
So p is a prime number, right? So in set A we have p mass 1 numbers.

77
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:31,519
OK, we look at another set, so another set B.

78
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:44,519
So B's set, because we have the parameter a here, we want to integrate a in the set of members.

79
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:54,519
So every member with times a, a, 2a, 3a, and p mass 1a.

80
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:07,519
Also we have, so a, all members times a, respectively, we get B, p mass 1 numbers.

81
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:15,519
We have mod p operation. So from B to C, each member will take the mod p operation.

82
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:41,519
We get a set C like a mod p, 2a mod p, 3a mod p, so the last one is p mass 1 times a mod p.

83
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:50,519
OK, now we look at this set C, a mod p, 2a mod p, what property?

84
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,519
So property is, we have one conclusion to say that.

85
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:17,519
Any from this set C, any two numbers are different.

86
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:25,519
Any two numbers in this set C are different. If not, so we rather pick two numbers.

87
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:38,519
Suppose they are t times a mod p, and s times a mod p.

88
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:50,519
We assume that t is bigger than zero, smaller than s, smaller than p mass 1.

89
00:12:50,519 --> 00:13:01,519
Any two numbers, for this set C, any two, so t, s, should be different.

90
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:10,519
They represent two numbers, they should be at least three y and smaller than p. The last one is p mass 1.

91
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,519
No problem, right? We pick two numbers.

92
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:30,519
So if they are the same, if they are equal, and this implies t times a mod p equals s times a mod p.

93
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:41,519
So this implies t times a is equal to s times a mod p.

94
00:13:42,519 --> 00:14:03,519
Well previously we learned that if the GCD a p is 1, so of course because p is a prime number, and a is not divisible by p.

95
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:16,519
So in fact this one implies GCD value a and p is 1.

96
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:27,519
a is not divisible by p, p is not a prime number of a, and p is a prime.

97
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:39,519
They do not have any common divisor except 1. But without a, because 1 contains a prime number of p.

98
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:47,519
p has two functions, one is 1, one is p. No p, their common divisor is 1.

99
00:14:49,519 --> 00:15:00,519
So we have previously learned that if GCD a p is 1, this a can be cancelled, can be removed.

100
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:09,519
So this implies t is equal to s times a mod p. However, this is not possible.

101
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:23,519
This contradicts our assumption of two numbers. p times a is contained from that group, from cc.

102
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,519
Their value should range from 0 to t.

103
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:41,519
So from here we show that two distinct numbers, if they are not equal to a, their mod value is the same. That's not possible.

104
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
So this is a contradiction.

105
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:57,519
Based on this result, any two numbers are different. If they are the same, any two to be the same, we can have this contradiction.

106
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,519
So now we say any two numbers are different, and their value...

107
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:29,519
So we have the cc, we also have p-mass-1 numbers in all data in the range from 1 to p-mass-1.

108
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:46,519
So zero, right? Because all the numbers p-mass-1 to a, the relative prime of p cannot be zero, no factor of p.

109
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:55,519
And the distinct, they are different. So their range is actually from 1 to p-mass-1.

110
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:07,519
When p-mass-1 numbers are all distinct, no repetition, p-mass-1 numbers, that means their value must be from 1 to p-mass-1.

111
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,519
So this implies actually that set a equals set c.

112
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,519
So this implies set a equals set c.

113
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:33,519
If set a equals set c, we time all numbers together.

114
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:41,519
When time a, this result equals with time all the numbers in set c.

115
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:48,519
When we time a, we have 1 times 2 times 3 times p-mass-1.

116
00:17:49,519 --> 00:18:03,519
And the set c, after it is a times 2a times 3a times p-mass-1a, we mod p operation.

117
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,519
Right? Because in set c we have mod p operation.

118
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:21,519
So the right-hand side, we have how many a? 1 times 2 times 3 times p-mass-1.

119
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,519
And number of a is a to the power p-mass-1.

120
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,519
p-mass-1 numbers.

121
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,519
Number of a is a to the power p-mass-1.

122
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,519
This is a mod p operation.

123
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:56,519
And similarly we have the GCD 1 times 2 times 3 times p-mass-1 with p, this is 1.

124
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,519
1, 2, they are all relative prime to p.

125
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,519
We time them together, that data is also relative prime to p.

126
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,519
The largest common divisor is 1.

127
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,519
So both sides, this factor can be cancelled.

128
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:34,519
So the left-hand side is 1, the left-hand side is a to the p-mass-1 mod p.

129
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,519
It's common 2.

130
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,519
Common 2, common 2.

131
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,519
So thus we have this famous theorem result.

132
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,519
Not very difficult, right?

133
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,519
So in this proof you can see we need to understand the prime number p,

134
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,519
and we construct a set with four numbers from 1 to p-mass-1.

135
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,519
Hopefully we have p-mass-1 numbers distinct, different.

136
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,519
And we involve the factor of a and we take the mod p operation.

137
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,519
Time them together, that same a and c are the same.

138
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:33,519
So finally we have this a to the p-mass-1 is common to 1 mod p, we have this result.

139
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,519
So this is a good process to understand the mod operation prime numbers.

140
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:54,519
Of course you can test the famous theorem with the a equals 7, p equals 19.

141
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:06,519
So according to the famous theorem it is a to p-mass-1 is common to 1 mod p.

142
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:15,519
In this example a is 7, p-mass-1 is 18, common to 1 mod 19.

143
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,519
Of course you can refer to the previous table.

144
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:28,519
The 7 on this row is a to p-mass-1 is common to p-mass-1.

145
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:35,519
So we have a to p-mass-1 is common to p-mass-1.

146
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:53,519
The 7 on this row is 1. Of course it is 1.

147
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:13,519
We look at another important concept, it is called the Euler's totient function phi n.

148
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:17,519
Phi is used in the RSA algorithm.

149
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:26,519
Phi n is the number of positive integers less than n and are relative prime to n.

150
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,519
So we define if a equals 1, we have 1.

151
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:45,519
If a equals 2, our number of positive integers less than 2 and are relative prime to n, we have a single one, 1.

152
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,519
Because GCD, 2, 1 is 1.

153
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:04,519
These are 3, we have two numbers, 2 and 1.

154
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,519
Smaller than 3 and relative prime to 3, we have two numbers, 2.

155
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:18,519
And 4, what are those two numbers? 1 and 3.

156
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:27,519
Two numbers, these are 4 and are relative prime to 4, 1 and 3.

157
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:31,519
How about 5? 5 we have 1, 2, 3, 4, right?

158
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,519
We have 4 numbers.

159
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,519
6 we have 1 and 5, two numbers.

160
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,519
7 we have 1, 2, 6.

161
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:54,519
8 we have 1, 3, 5, 7.

162
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:09,519
And 9 we have 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.

163
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:15,519
8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, yeah.

164
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:26,519
So 10 we have 1, 3, 7.

165
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,519
9, right?

166
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,519
4 numbers.

167
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:44,519
And now, so far you can find this file to denote all the numbers less than the given n and are relative prime to n.

168
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,519
Remember how many of those numbers.

169
00:24:48,519 --> 00:25:15,519
Okay, based on this ONA's totient function phi n, if p is a prime number, of course all the numbers from 1, 2, 3 till p must 1, all of them are relative prime.

170
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:38,519
So they are relative, relative prime, prime to p.

171
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:47,519
So this phi p is p must 1, the common divisor is 1.

172
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,519
So relative.

173
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:14,519
Okay, if n is, n equals p to k, and p is prime, then phi equals tk, must tk, must not mean.

174
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:39,519
So one example, suppose, just like, one example is, if n is 8, t is 2, 8 equals 2 to the 3, right?

175
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:55,519
So phi n equals phi 8, equals 2 to the 3, minus 2 to the 2.

176
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:59,519
This is 8 minus 44.

177
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,519
So phi 8 equals 4.

178
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:11,519
According to this equation, it shows the result is 2.

179
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:33,519
So of course what we can see is, we should remove all the elements that are not relative prime to p.

180
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:41,519
That means we should remove all members who contain a factor of p.

181
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:55,519
So in this example also we can construct two sets, set A with all members from 1, 2, 3 till pk must 1.

182
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:04,519
So this is set with all members to be smaller than n, so we have pk must 1 numbers.

183
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:17,519
In set B, we should remove all members that are, that contains a factor of p.

184
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,519
Smallest one is p, right?

185
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,519
We have 2p, 3p.

186
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:38,519
So the last one is p times, so the last one actually is pk must p.

187
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:53,519
So this one can be represented as p times pk must 1, must 1.

188
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,519
Right?

189
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:09,519
Okay, so this phi n equals the number of elements in A, minus the number of elements in B.

190
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:18,519
Because all members in B contains the common divisor of p.

191
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,519
So phi n, n contains the p.

192
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:32,519
And 1, no other, no other prime numbers.

193
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:41,519
So we should remove all the numbers with p as the factor.

194
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,519
What is the difference between p and the prime number?

195
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:57,519
For the number of elements in p, it is from 1, 2, 3 till pk must 1, must 1.

196
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:13,519
So this number of p of B, number of A is here, pk must 1, number of B is here.

197
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,519
pk must 1, must 1.

198
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,519
And also we have the result, pk must pk 2.

199
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,519
And here, this result.

200
00:30:43,519 --> 00:31:03,519
Another very important property is if n equals p times q, well both p and q are prime numbers.

201
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,519
The phi n equals p must 1 times q must 1.

202
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:16,519
So this one I put it in an exercise for your homework.

203
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,519
You can take home and exercise, think about how you can prove this property.

204
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,519
Well, 31 is a prime number, right?

205
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:38,519
So 31 is a prime number p, and this equals p must 1, so this equals 30.

206
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:55,519
And 32, this is 2 to the 5th, so this equals 2 to the 5th must 2 to the 4th is 16.

207
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,519
33 is 3 times 11, 2 prime numbers, the problem.

208
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,519
So this equals 2 times 10, 20.

209
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:16,519
34 is 2 times 17, 2 prime numbers, this equals 1 times 16, 16.

210
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,519
So this is 5 times 7, this is 4 times 6, 24.

211
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:40,519
Okay, you can well do it by yourself to check whether you can try this property or previous one to get the result.

212
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,519
So this is the definition and some calculation of the Euler's theorem.

213
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:54,519
From Euler's current function, we have this Euler's theorem.

214
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:03,519
The Euler's theorem states that for every a and n, that are relative prime numbers.

215
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,519
Relative prime.

216
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:29,519
Relative prime means n is not a n or relative prime, so that means GCT a n equals 1, so this is only relative prime.

217
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:37,519
Then we have a to the psi n is convert to 1 mod n.

218
00:33:37,519 --> 00:34:06,519
So one example, suppose a equals 4, n equals 15, so GCT a GCT 4 and 15, the greatest common divisor is 1.

219
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,519
We should first calculate the 5, 15.

220
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:23,519
15 equals 3 times 5, 2 prime numbers, so this 2 times 4 equals 8.

221
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:37,519
According to this Euler's theorem, we have 4 to the 8 is convert to 1 mod 15.

222
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:44,519
So this is psi n, this is a, this is n.

223
00:34:53,519 --> 00:35:13,519
If we times a at both sides, this times a, this times a, we have a to the psi n plus 1 is convert to a mod n.

224
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:32,519
OK, so this one, in fact, you can see, is very close to our some encryption, the decryption process.

225
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,519
You can regard a to be a message.

226
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:44,519
After some operation, you take n, you can get a back.

227
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:55,519
So this is a, you do some encryption and then you do some decryption, somehow you get the result to be same.

228
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:04,519
So we are very close to the public key scheme, the original RSA algorithm.

229
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:11,519
OK, for this one, we also can prove it.

230
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:18,519
And the proof process is quite close to the Fermat's algorithm.

231
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:33,519
We can construct three sets, a set with all members, t1, t2, till t by n.

232
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:42,519
So this is all the data that are very close to n.

233
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:55,519
Because n is not a prime number anymore, we only select those numbers that are very close to n.

234
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,519
And total number is 5, this definition of psi n logic.

235
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,519
So we have five numbers.

236
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:19,519
So remember phi n is all the numbers that are less than n and are relative to prime to n,

237
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:25,519
within this set, this total number, phi n.

238
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:45,519
OK, similarly, we can construct b to times a, so we have this set t1 times a, t2 times a, and till t phi n times a.

239
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:56,519
Similarly, we have five numbers, and then we take the mod n operation, then we get a safe c.

240
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:12,519
So we have t1 times a, mod n, t2 times a, mod n, till t phi n times p, mod n.

241
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:27,519
And similarly, we can argue any two from this set c, any two are different.

242
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:45,519
The reason is because GCD a n is 1, GCD any t i n also take 1.

243
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:54,519
Any t i from set a, that is the value is 1, and GCD a n is 1.

244
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:07,519
So we have this result cannot be the same, otherwise we have the same condition as in the theorem.

245
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:17,519
If any two are different, that means in this set we also have phi n numbers.

246
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,519
So this is because we have this given condition.

247
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:30,519
So that means from the set c we have phi n distinct numbers.

248
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:45,519
And this t1 times a, t i times a, mod n times p, mod n, till t phi n times p, mod n.

249
00:39:45,519 --> 00:40:05,519
And this t1 times a, t i times a, mod n, value.

250
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,519
That's the result.

251
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,519
It's also very important.

252
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:36,519
So also you can have this conclusion that GCD any t i times a, mod n, that value with n is also to be 1.

253
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:45,519
So t i times a has no common divisor with n.

254
00:40:45,519 --> 00:41:01,519
A no common divisor with n, t i no common divisor with n, but a no common divisor, t i no common divisor.

255
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:09,519
So t i times a also no common divisor with n.

256
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:16,519
So those two are really prime.

257
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:31,519
Based on this fact, we argue all the members in set c are different and they are really prime to n.

258
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,519
So that means totally we have phi n numbers.

259
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,519
So this implies a equals c.

260
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,519
So phi a equals phi c.

261
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:51,519
So phi means the product of all members in the set.

262
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,519
We take the mod and operation.

263
00:41:54,519 --> 00:42:23,519
And this finally we have t1 times t2 times phi n equals the right hand side we have t1 times a, mod n, this one times t2 times a, mod n, so on so forth.

264
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:33,519
And the right hand side is t1 times t2 times t phi n.

265
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:41,519
And for a, we only have phi n times, so we have phi n numbers.

266
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,519
And this part can be cancelled.

267
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:54,519
So this implies mod n operation.

268
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:06,519
This implies the a phi n is coming to 1 with mod n, this operation.

269
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:33,519
Okay, you can regard this one without proof of process why the Euler's Theorem is correct.

270
00:43:45,519 --> 00:44:14,519
So now we can test the Euler's Theorem with this small log.

271
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:21,519
The first one, n is 10, first we need to calculate phi n.

272
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:28,519
So this n equals 2 times 5, 2 prime numbers.

273
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,519
So phi equals 1 times 4 is 4.

274
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:44,519
According to the Euler's Theorem, which is a to the phi n, phi is 4, mod n.

275
00:44:45,519 --> 00:45:02,519
So the a is 3, 3 to the 4, it is 81.

276
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,519
It's coming to 1 with mod 10.

277
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,519
This is true.

278
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:20,519
We look at the second one.

279
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:27,519
n equals 11, this phi n, phi 11 is, n is the prime number.

280
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:29,519
Equals p-major is this 10.

281
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:39,519
And this 2 to the 10, mod 11, we know it is 1 over 24.

282
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:48,519
So 1 over 24 equals 93 times 11 plus 1.

283
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:55,519
So of course this one is coming to 1, a problem, incorrect.

284
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:23,519
Okay, well for this Euler's Theorem, actually you can see it is very close to the public key scheme.

285
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:29,519
A is the mean, after some operation, we can get back to A itself.

286
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:35,519
Okay, so this is the public key scheme, very close.

287
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:47,519
We skip our break, so let's try to finish our part 4, and we'll finish today's lecture too.

288
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:56,519
Part 4 is about how we can apply very efficient model operations for very large numbers.

289
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,519
And then we can apply the CRT, the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

290
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,519
So what are the purpose of this one?

291
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:09,519
The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells you that,

292
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:27,519
given we have very large number exponential operations mod some prime numbers,

293
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:35,519
we can have this quick way to decide the result.

294
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:52,519
Really because in the RSA algorithm, we need to calculate the message to a public key mod a given number n.

295
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,519
Message to the E mod n.

296
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:03,519
And this n can be factored to be two prime numbers, p and q.

297
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:10,519
In the RSA algorithm, we will choose two big prime numbers, p and q.

298
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,519
So E is a given public key.

299
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,519
So normally we need to do this kind of calculation.

300
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:29,519
However, because n is very large, in fact, we can first calculate m to the E is also very large.

301
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:39,519
But once we have this mE mod p, we get some R1 value.

302
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:46,519
mE mod q, we get R2 value.

303
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:58,519
So these two values will be much easier to calculate compared to any mod n, because both t and q are much smaller.

304
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:07,519
So the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells you that from these two equations,

305
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:15,519
we get a unique number x, a unique x.

306
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:23,519
To be smaller than n, we can decide this x.

307
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:30,519
So CRT, this theorem can do that. We can calculate this n.

308
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:39,519
And this n, in fact, equals the original big number, m to the E mod n.

309
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:49,519
Rather than to calculate mE mod x, we can calculate mE mod t and mE mod q.

310
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:57,519
From two reminders, we apply the CRT algorithm. We can quickly get x, like here.

311
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:04,519
So that's the purpose we apply the CRT on this operation here.

312
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:13,519
To make the calculation to be four times faster than the original calculation.

313
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:18,519
OK, so this is the purpose.

314
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,519
Now we look at what's the meaning for the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

315
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:32,519
And this one is believed to have been discovered by the Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu in around 100 AD.

316
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,519
And this one is one of the most useful results of number theory.

317
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:53,519
It says that it is possible to reconstruct integers in a certain range from their residues modulo a set of pairwise vector prime moduli.

318
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:59,519
OK, you know the story, right?

319
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:11,519
So, normally you don't know the number, but you count a group of items 3 by 3, then the net is 2.

320
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:22,519
You count all the numbers 5 by 5, because you divide the numbers by 5, the remainder is 3, the remainder is 3.

321
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:30,519
You count them by 7, the net, the remainder will be 2.

322
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,519
So the question is, what is the original number of items here?

323
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:46,519
So you can find this story in the She-Diao-Ying-Cheng-Zhuang, used by Jin Yong to test how smart you are.

324
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:54,519
OK, we can have a formal definition of this DRG.

325
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:06,519
Let n1, n sub 1, n sub 2 sub k be integers greater than 1, recorded to be moduli or divisors.

326
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:13,519
And let us denote by n the product of the ni.

327
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:22,519
So n is n1, n sub 1 times n sub 2 times n sub k.

328
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:32,519
The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that if the ni are pairwise co-prime,

329
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:45,519
So pairwise co-prime, that means just like GCD, ni, and j is 1.

330
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:51,519
Any two, their greatest common denominator is 1.

331
00:52:51,519 --> 00:53:07,519
And if a1, a sub 1, a sub k are integers, but that will kill the ai in this range for every i, then there is only one integer x.

332
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:19,519
So we have this x in this range, and the remainder of the Euclidean division of x by n i is ai for every i.

333
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:31,519
In other words, this x, well, mod n i, we have a1, and mod n k, we have ak.

334
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:39,519
So from all these k equations, we say we have a unique x.

335
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:51,519
So this x is smaller than n, non-negative.

336
00:53:51,519 --> 00:54:03,519
Next, divided by n sub 1, the remainder is a1.

337
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:08,519
Finally, we have this k equations.

338
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:22,519
The Chinese remainder theorem tells you that we have a unique x in this range, one x, to stand by all k equations.

339
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:35,519
So one example here is, suppose x, according to the previous problem, we count x by 3, the left is 2.

340
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:49,519
We count all x by 5, the left is 3, we count x by 7, so divided by 7, 7 by 7, 7 as a group, the remainder is 2.

341
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:56,519
What's the original x? So we have 3 propositions, p1, p2, p3.

342
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:17,519
From proposition 1, of course, from this one, we have, easily we can get x equals 3 times t plus 2.

343
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:25,519
But either 3 times the multiple of 3 times 2.

344
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:28,519
So from proposition 1, we have this one.

345
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:38,519
From this, well, if x equals this value, we use the second proposition.

346
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:54,519
So the second proposition means 3t plus 2, when we multiply by 5, this will convert to 3.

347
00:55:54,519 --> 00:56:04,519
So from proposition 2, this means x mod 5 equals 3.

348
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,519
So this implies 2, both sides we have minus 2.

349
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:19,519
So 3t will convert to 3 minus 2, mod 5.

350
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:24,519
So we have this equation.

351
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,519
3t is converted to 1, mod 5.

352
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,519
This is the result of the second proposition.

353
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,519
So what is the mod 5 operation if t, we don't have t?

354
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:59,519
So t value, t value can be anyone from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

355
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,519
Because it is mod 5, we don't need to use t to define the game.

356
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:07,519
Mod 5 gives you a loop.

357
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:10,519
If t is 0, mod 5 is 0.

358
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:13,519
3t is 0.

359
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:16,519
3t mod 5 is 0, right?

360
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:24,519
If t is 1, 3t is what's the value?

361
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:27,519
What's the value?

362
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:31,519
3.

363
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:34,519
3t mod 5 is 3.

364
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:37,519
If t is 2, 3t is what?

365
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:39,519
6.

366
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:42,519
3t mod 5 is 1.

367
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:49,519
t is 3, 3t is 9, mod 5 is 4.

368
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:56,519
4, 3t, 12, 2, right?

369
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,519
If it is 5, it is beyond 0.

370
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:06,519
Okay, we have the result 3t mod 5 is 1.

371
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,519
That means this row.

372
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:21,519
So this implies t mod 5 should be 2.

373
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:25,519
t mod 5 should be 2.

374
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:30,519
t mod 5 can be 1 and 0 and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4.

375
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:39,519
But only if t is 2, then 3t mod 1 can be 1.

376
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,519
So we have this problem 4.

377
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,519
t can be represented as 1.

378
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:56,519
So t can be represented as 5s plus 2.

379
00:58:57,519 --> 00:58:59,519
mod 5 equals 2.

380
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:01,519
5s equals 2.

381
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,519
So that means for both p1 and p2, we have this x.

382
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,519
We have x equals 3t plus 2.

383
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:25,519
And this t, 5s plus 2, to substitute this t, we have 3 times 5s plus 2 plus 2.

384
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:31,519
So we have 15s plus 8 here.

385
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:40,519
Okay, from proposition p1 and proposition 2, we have the conclusion.

386
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:53,519
x can be represented as 15s plus 8.

387
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:55,519
Is that clear?

388
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:00,519
We only have two propositions.

389
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:04,519
So we can say the original x can be 8.

390
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:14,519
If we only have one proposition, we say we count items plus 3, then there will be 2.

391
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,519
If only this condition, the original item can be what?

392
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:21,519
Number of items can be what?

393
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:23,519
Can be 2, right?

394
01:00:24,519 --> 01:00:25,519
Just two items.

395
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:27,519
We count them plus 3, then there will be 2.

396
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:31,519
So 2 is the correct answer.

397
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:37,519
So now suppose we have two propositions, we count them 5 by 5.

398
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:40,519
So that is 3.

399
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:43,519
Then we have the answer.

400
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:46,519
The original items can be 8.

401
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:58,519
So 8 satisfies proposition 1 in order of proposition 2.

402
01:00:58,519 --> 01:01:03,519
But we have three conditions, so we need to continue.

403
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,519
Now we look at proposition 3.

404
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:15,519
So because x is 15s plus 1, we take mod 7 operation.

405
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:29,519
Mod 7, so this is after it can be represented as 14s plus 8 plus 7 plus 1, we convert to 2 mod 7.

406
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,519
So 14s mod 7 is 0.

407
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:34,519
This is 0.

408
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:45,519
And we have 8s plus 1, 8s plus 1 convert to 2 mod 7.

409
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:51,519
So this one implies 8s mod 7 equals 1.

410
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:53,519
Right?

411
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:55,519
8s mod 7 equals 1.

412
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,519
So 8s plus 1 mod 7 equals 2.

413
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:02,519
So we have this equation.

414
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,519
So 8s mod 7 equals 1.

415
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:14,519
Then we have 8s can be represented as 7 times u plus 1.

416
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:22,519
So this 8s, we can substitute 8s to be here.

417
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:30,519
Then finally we have 8s to be 105 times u plus 23.

418
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:36,519
And here, so 8s equals 7u plus 1.

419
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,519
We look at 8s, that equation.

420
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:48,519
Substitute 8s by 7u plus 1, so we have 8s equals 1 plus u plus 23.

421
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,519
And this is a general form to represent the value of x.

422
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:03,519
And note that 105 is a deep common multiple of 3, 5, 7.

423
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,519
3, 5, 7, or the modular here.

424
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:09,519
3, 5, 7.

425
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:17,519
So then we have a solution, 23, 128, 233.

426
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:20,519
Multiple of 105.

427
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:27,519
However, in this range, 2 times 3 times 5.

428
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:36,519
3 times 5 times 7, this equals 5.

429
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:43,519
We have a unique x to be 23.

430
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:45,519
23.

431
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:53,519
So of course, the original number according to that counting is not unique.

432
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:57,519
We have 23, 128, and so on.

433
01:03:58,519 --> 01:04:06,519
But before that, 105, we have a unique value to be 23 in this problem.

434
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:16,519
OK, now we have this exercise.

435
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,519
Suppose x mod 5 is 3, x mod 7 is 4.

436
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:22,519
What's x?

437
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:25,519
I give you 5 minutes.

438
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:31,519
Anyone can provide me the correct answer, then you can leave. Otherwise, stay here.

439
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:35,519
So how is it?

440
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:38,519
What's x? Tell me.

441
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,519
5 minutes.

442
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:14,519
Thank you.

443
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:44,519
Thank you.

444
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:14,519
Thank you.

445
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:44,519
Thank you.

446
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:14,519
Thank you.

447
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:44,519
Thank you.

448
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:14,519
Thank you.

449
01:08:43,520 --> 01:09:03,520
OK, some of you have solved the problem, so you can dry your teeth.

450
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,520
You have played so long, it's finished.

451
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,520
Just give some time to others to finish, OK?

452
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,520
Thank you.

453
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:27,520
OK, we look at the solution to this one.

454
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:34,520
In fact, because the number is not large, to get the result is not difficult.

455
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:42,520
Normally, my practice is to start from the mod, the moduli to be a bigger one, 7.

456
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:56,520
So from the second equation, we can get x to be 7t plus 4, right?

457
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,520
Now mod 7 is 4.

458
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,520
Then we look at the first equation.

459
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:13,520
So 7t plus 4, this one mod 5, it comes to 3, mod 5.

460
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:27,520
Well, this mod 3, the left hand side mod 4, so this mod 7t, it comes to mod 5.

461
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:42,520
So we have 5t plus 2t, mod 4, comes to 3, mod 5.

462
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:57,520
So both sides actually, this side you can add 3 plus 5 to be 8, mod 5, doesn't matter.

463
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:08,520
So we have this 5t to be, can be 0, so this implies 2t is congruent to 4, mod 5.

464
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:15,520
And also you need to find what's the t value.

465
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:24,520
So 2t, because what you know is the GCD, 2, 5 is 1.

466
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,520
So this implies we can cancel t from both sides.

467
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:35,520
t is congruent to 2, mod 5.

468
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:46,520
This 2, they are relatively prime, so 2 can be, as a factor, can be cancelled.

469
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:59,520
So t is, so t can be 5 times x plus 2, we can substitute this one to be here,

470
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:19,520
and then we get x equals 7 times 5s plus 2, and then plus 4, so this represented as 75 times s plus 18.

471
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:25,520
This is a general form to represent the value of x.

472
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:34,520
If the x to be smaller than 35, we have Unix x to be 18.

473
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:47,520
So this 35 comes from 5 times 7, 5 times 7 from here, the two modulus.

474
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:57,520
Okay, then we finish today's lecture very good.

475
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,520
We finished all the required knowledge.

476
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:09,520
So from next class, we will study how we can derive the RSA algorithm from today's owners theorem.

477
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:23,520
And then we know how we can design the public key and private key to apply the public key and private key to the buy encryption, decryption, and to design the signature.

478
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,520
So of course we have some take-home exercises.

479
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:36,520
You can do some more practice, okay, to try to solve these exercises by yourself.

480
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,520
Okay, thank you, so that's all for today's lecture.

481
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,520
So any questions, I'm still here, you can come and ask me.

482
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,520
Okay, I will see you next week.
