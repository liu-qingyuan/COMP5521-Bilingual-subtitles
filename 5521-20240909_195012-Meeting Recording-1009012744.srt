1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay, anyone got the result?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:31,000
64, that's correct.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So let's see how we can get the result to be 64.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, we can go back to the previous slide.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, at this part, right?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So we start from this row, one can be represented as 13.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So 13 minus 3 times 4.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And this 3, 13 minus 3 is minus 4 times 6.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
3 is from combination of 16 and 13.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
16 minus 13.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So this 5 times 13 minus 4 times 16.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, and this 13 can be represented as some combination of 5 times 13.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
93 minus 5 times 16.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Minus 4 times 16.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So this 5 times 93, 1.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This 25 minus 4, this is 29 times 16.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
All right?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, we want to get mod to the inverse of 16.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mod 93.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So both sides we take mod 93.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this part is 0.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And this part, that means this is a minus 29 is a multi-inverse of 16.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So this is component 2, 93 minus 29.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So this equals 64.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mod 93.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So this is x value, right?

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So 64 is the modular inverse of 16 mod 93.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay?

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Any questions, comments?

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So this result is 64.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, now we go to part 3.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So part 3, we'll study the prime numbers.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
From prime numbers, we will learn the Feynman theorem.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then we'll continue with the Euler's theorem.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No problem.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Prime numbers are those numbers with dividers of 1 and itself.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Just like 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All the numbers are called to be composite numbers.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's 4 and 6.

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And we have the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That means any integer to be bigger than 1 can be substituted in a unique way as

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
a equals p1 to the a1 times p2 to the a2 times pk to the at.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So p1 is more than p2.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's more than pt.

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Those are the prime numbers.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And where each ai is positive integer, so a1, a2 are as the exponent part.

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:07,000
For example, 24 can be substituted as 2 to the 3 times 3 to the 1, right?

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:20,000
2 prime numbers to the exponent to be 3 and 1.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
OK, here we have all the primes under 2 solid prime numbers.

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's hard to tell which one is a prime number or not.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's better when the number is very large.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
How to test a number is prime?

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's a challenge problem.

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now we look at the Fermat's theorem.

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Fermat's theorem states that if p is prime and a is a positive integer, not divisible by p,

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
then we have a to the p-mass one is congruent to 1 mod p.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So a is a positive integer, not divisible by p.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Suppose p is a prime.

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
One example just like if p is a prime number 7, so a equals 4 or 10,

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So p is not a factor of a, so a is not divisible by p.

61
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Just like in this example, a equals 4, a equals 10.

62
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So p is not a factor of a.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then we have this equation, a to the p-mass one.

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If p-mass one is, in this example, is 6.

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So a is 4 to the 6 is congruent to 1 mod 7.

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or 10 to the 6 is congruent to 1 mod 7.

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So this is a statement.

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And the platform is, well, at both sides with times a,

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So the net size is a to the p is congruent to a mod p.

70
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's mod p.

71
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So this is the Fermat's theorem.

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Here is the table to show that for any given, the p to be 19, to be a prime number.

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
For any number a, a is from, in this column, 1, 2, 3, 0, 18.

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
For the number a is smaller than p, of course, p is not a factor of a.

75
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So if a is smaller than p, a is not divisible by p, according to the Fermat's theorem.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Or the a to the p-mass one is congruent to 1 mod p.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So if we look at the last column, so here is a to the 18 is congruent to 1 when mod 19.

78
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So the last column, no matter what the value of a, y, or h, the last column for the value to be 1.

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay, so this is the Fermat's theorem.

80
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
To tell you, this is the rule of this problem you can find.

81
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So we need to understand how we can prove this process.

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We apply proof for us to understand the modular operation.

83
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:48,000
In this statement, in Fermat's theorem, if p is prime and a is a positive integer not divisible by p, so we have this equation, y is congruent.

84
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The proof process is quite interesting, so I would like to share it with you.

85
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Suppose we have a set to prove it, we can construct some sets.

86
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So set a with all members 1, 2, 3, till p-mass 1.

87
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So p is a prime number, right?

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So in set a, we have p-mass 1, numbers.

89
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay, we look at another set.

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So another set b.

91
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So b is set, because we have the parameter a here, we want to integrate a in a set of members.

92
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So every member with times a, a, 2a, 3a, and p-mass 1a.

93
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Also we have, so a, all members times a, respectively, we get b, p-mass 1, numbers.

94
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We have mod p operation.

95
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So from b to c, each member will take the mod p operation.

96
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We get a set c, like a mod p, 2a mod p, 3a mod p.

97
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So the last one is p-mass 1 times a mod p.

98
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay, now we look at this set c, a mod p, 2a mod p, mod property.

99
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So property is, we have one conclusion to say that any from this set c, any two numbers.

100
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
are different.

101
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Any two numbers in this set c are different.

102
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If not, so we run p2 numbers, suppose they are t times a mod p, and s times a mod p.

103
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And we assume that t is bigger than 0, smaller than s, smaller than p-mass 1.

104
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But any two numbers in this set c, any two, so t, s, should be different.

105
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe if there are two numbers, there should be one smaller than p.

106
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The last one is p-mass 1.

107
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No problem, right? We take two numbers.

108
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So if they are the same, they are equal.

109
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And this implies t times a mod p equals s times a mod p.

110
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So this implies t times a is equal to s times a mod p.

111
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We previously learned that if the gcd a, p is 1, so of course because p is a prime number,

112
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and a is not divisible by p.

113
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So in fact, this one implies gcd value a and p is 1.

114
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:28,000
a is not divisible by p, p is not a prime number of a and p is a prime.

115
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They do not have any common divisor except 1.

116
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But because a does not contain such a p,

117
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
p has two functions, one is 1, one is p.

118
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No p, their common divisor is 1.

119
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So we have previously learned that if gcd a, p is 1, this a can be cancelled, can be removed.

120
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So this implies t is common to s mod p.

121
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
However, this is not possible.

122
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This contradicts our assumption that two numbers,

123
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
p times a and s times a from that group, from cc,

124
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
their value should be range from 0 to te.

125
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So from here we show that two distinct numbers have equal value to this.

126
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's not possible.

127
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So this is a contradiction.

128
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Based on this result, any two numbers are different.

129
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If not the same, any two to be the same, we can have this contradiction.

130
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So now we say any two numbers are different,

131
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and their value,

132
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
so we have the cc, we also have p must 1 numbers

133
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
in the whole data,

134
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
in the range

135
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
from 1 to p must 1.

136
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So 0, right?

137
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Because all the numbers, p must 1 to a,

138
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the relative prime of p cannot be 0.

139
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No factor of p.

140
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And you see the difference.

141
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So their range is actually from 1 to p must 1.

142
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
When p must 1 numbers, they are all distinct.

143
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No repetition.

144
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
p must 1 numbers, that means their value must be from 1 to p must 1.

145
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So this implies actually the set A equals set C.

146
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So this implies set A equals set C.

147
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If set A equals set C, we time all members.

148
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Together, with time A,

149
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
this result equals with time all the numbers in set C.

150
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
In with time A, we have 1 times 2 times 3 times p must 1.

151
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And the set C, actually it is A times 2A times 3A times p must 1A,

152
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
with not p operation.

153
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Right?

154
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Because in set C, we have no p operation.

155
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So the right-hand side, we have how many A?

156
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
1 times 2 times 3 times p must 1.

157
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And number of A is A to the power p must 1.

158
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And p must 1 numbers.

159
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Number of A in this fraction will be A to the p must 1.

160
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Minus, this is the more p operation.

161
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And similarly, we have the GCD, 1 times 2 times 3 times p must 1,

162
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
with p, this is 1.

163
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
1 to the whole relative prime to p.

164
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When coming together, that data is also relative prime to p.

165
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The log is common divided by 1.

166
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So both sides, this factor can be cancelled.

167
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So the left-hand side is 1.

168
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The left-hand side is A to the p must 1.

169
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Number of p is countering 2.

170
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Countering 2, countering 2.

171
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So thus, we have this famous theorem result.

172
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Not very difficult, right?

173
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So in this proof policy, you can see we need to understand

174
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
the final number p, and we construct a set with four numbers from 1 to p must 1.

175
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hopefully, we have p must 1 numbers distinct, different.

176
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And we evolve the factor of A, and we take the both p operations.

177
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Come together, start saying A and C are the same.

178
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So finally, we have this A to the p must 1.

179
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's common to want more p. We have this result.

180
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So this is a proof policy to understand the mode of operation prime numbers.

181
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Of course, you can test the famous theorem with the A equals 7, p equals 19.

182
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So according to the famous theorem, it is A to p must 1 is common to 1 mod p.

183
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
In this example, A is 7, p must 1 is 18,

184
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
common to 1 mod 19. Of course, you can refer to previous table, right?

185
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The 7 on this row is 1. Of course, it is 1.

186
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We look at another important concept. It's called the Euler's total function phi n.

187
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So phi is used in the RSA algorithm.

188
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So phi n is the number of positive integers raised by n and raised from prime to n.

189
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So we define if n equals 1, we have 1.

190
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If n equals 2, the number of positive integers raised by n is 2.

191
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And then raised from prime to n, we have a single one, 1.

192
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Because GCD to 1 is 1.

193
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
These are 3. We have two numbers.

194
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
2 and 1, smaller than 3, and raised from prime to 3, we have two numbers, 2.

195
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And 4, one of those two numbers, 1 and 3, right?

196
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Two numbers. This one, 4 and raised from prime to 4, 1 is 3.

197
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
5, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, right?

198
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We have 4 numbers, 4. 6, we have 1 and 5, two numbers.

199
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:55,000
7, we have 1 to 6. 8, we have 1, 3, 5, 7.

200
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And 9, we have 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, here.

201
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So 10, we have 1, 3, 7, 9, right?

202
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
4 numbers.

203
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And on the top board, you can find this phi n to denote all the numbers.

204
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
This is the given n and the relative prime to n, representing how many of those numbers.

205
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay, based on this, all those totient function phi n, if p is a prime number, of course, all the numbers from 1, 2, 3, till p must 1, all of them are relative prime.

206
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So they are relative, relative prime.

207
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Come to p.

208
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So this phi p is p must 1. The comedy value is 1.

209
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So very cheap.

210
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Okay, if n equals p to the k, and p is prime, then phi n equals p, k, then minus p, k must not mean.

211
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
If p is prime, then phi n equals p, k, then minus p, k must not mean.

212
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So one example, suppose, we'll just like...

213
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:40,000
One example is, if n is 8, p is 2, 8 equals 2 to the 3, right?

214
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So phi n equals phi 8 equals 2 to the 3 minus 2 to the 2.

215
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is 8 minus 4, which is 4.

216
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So phi 8 equals 4. According to this equation, it shows the result is true.

217
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So of course, what we can see is, we should remove all the elements that are not relative prime to p.

218
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That means we should remove all members who contains a factor of p.

219
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So in this example also, we can construct two sets. Set A with all members from 1, 2, 3, till p, k must 1.

220
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So this is set with all members to be smaller than n, so we have p, k must 1 numbers.

221
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
In set B, we should remove all members that contains a factor of p.

222
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Smallest one is p, right?

223
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We have 2p, 3p.

224
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So the last one is p times...

225
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So the last one actually is p, k minus p.

226
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So this one can be represented as p times p k must 1 must 1.

227
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Right?

228
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay, so this phi n equals the number of elements in A must number of elements in B, because all members in B contains the common divider of p.

229
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Just like n, n contains the p.

230
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And 1, no other numbers.

231
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So we should remove all the numbers with p as a factor.

232
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:59,000
For the number of elements in p, it is from 1, 2, 3, till p, k must 1 must 1.

233
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So this number of p of B, number of A is here.

234
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
p, k must 1.

235
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Number of B is here.

236
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
p, k must 1 must 1.

237
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And also we have the result.

238
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
p, k must p, k must 2.

239
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And we have this result.

240
00:30:41,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Another very important property is if n equals p times q, well both p and q are prime numbers, the phi n equals p must 1 times q must 1.

241
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So this one, I put it in an exercise for your homomorph.

242
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You can take home and exercise, think about how you can prove this property.

243
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Well 31 is a prime number, right?

244
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So 31 is a prime number p, and this equals p must 1, so this equals 30.

245
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And 32, this is 2 to the 5, so this equals 2 to the 5 must 2 to the 4 is 16.

246
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
33 is 3 times 11, 2 prime numbers, the product.

247
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So this equals 2 times 10 is 20.

248
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
34, it is 2 times 17, 2 prime numbers.

249
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
This equals 1 times 16.

250
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So this is 5 times 7, this is 4 times 6, this is 4.

251
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay, you can well do it by yourself to check whether you can try this property of previous one to get the result.

252
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So this is the definition and some calculation of the Euler's theorem.

253
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
From Euler's common function, we have this Euler's theorem.

254
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:04,000
The Euler's theorem states that for every a and n, there are relative primes.

255
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Relative prime.

256
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Relative prime means n is not an or relative prime.

257
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So that means gct an equals 1.

258
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So this is only the product.

259
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then we have a to the 5n is compared to 1 mod n.

260
00:33:38,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So one example suppose a equals 4, n equals 15, so gct a, gct 4, and 15, the greatest common divisor is 1.

261
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We should first calculate the 5, 15.

262
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
15 equals 3 times 5, 2 prime numbers.

263
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So this 2 times 4 equals 8.

264
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:38,000
According to this Euler's theorem, we have 4 to the 8 is compared to 1 mod 15.

265
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So this is 5n, this is a, this is n.

266
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:15,000
If we times a at both sides, this times a, this times a, we have a to the 5n plus 1 is compared to a mod n.

267
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So this one, in fact, you can see is very close to our some encryption process.

268
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You can regard a to be a message after some operation.

269
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You take it and you can get a back.

270
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So this is a, you do some encryption and you do some decryption, somehow you get the result to be same.

271
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So we are very close to the public key scheme, the original RSA algorithm.

272
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay, for this one, we also can prove it.

273
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And the proof process is quite close to the Fermat's algorithm.

274
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We can construct 3 sets A set with all members, T1, T2, T3, 5n.

275
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So these are all the data that are very close to n.

276
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Because n is not a prime number anymore, we only select those numbers that are very close to n.

277
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And total number is 5, this definition of 5n.

278
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So we have 5n numbers.

279
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So remember 5n is all the numbers that are less than n and are relative to prime to n.

280
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Within this total number, 5n.

281
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay, similarly, we can construct B to times A.

282
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So we have this set T1 times A, T2 times A, and here T5n times A.

283
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Similarly, we have 5 numbers, and then we take the mod n operation, then we get a safe C.

284
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So we have T1 times A, mod n, T2 times A, mod n, T5n times A, mod n.

285
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And similarly, we can argue any two from this set C. Any two are different.

286
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The reason is because GCD A n is 1, GCD NTI n is also T1.

287
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:58,000
NTI from set A, their GCD value is 1, and GCD A n is 1.

288
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So we have this result, cannot be the same. Otherwise, we have the same condition as in the theorem.

289
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:18,000
If any two are different, that means in this set, we also have 5n numbers.

290
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So this is because we have this even condition.

291
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So that means from the set C, we have 5n distinct numbers.

292
00:39:36,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And this T1 times A, T5 times A, mod n value.

293
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:20,000
That result is also 20.2n.

294
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So also you can have this conclusion, the GCD NTI times A, mod n, that value with n is also to be 1.

295
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So T1 times A has no common divisor with n.

296
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:02,000
T1 times A has no common divisor with n.

297
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So T1 times A also has no common divisor with n.

298
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So those two are virtually prime.

299
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Based on this fact, we all give all the methods in set C are different and are virtually prime to n.

300
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So let me tell you we have 5n numbers.

301
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So this implies A equals C.

302
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So pi A equals pi C. So pi means the product of all members in the set.

303
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
We take the mod n operation.

304
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And this finally we have with time A together, we have T1 times T2 times T5n equals the right hand side we have T1 times A, mod n.

305
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:26,000
This one times T2 times A, mod n, so on and so forth.

306
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And the right hand side is T1 times T2 times T5n.

307
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And for A, we only have 5n times.

308
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So we have 5n numbers. And this part can be cancelled.

309
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So this implies mod n operation.

310
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So this implies the A times n is equal to 1 when mod n is the operation.

311
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Okay, you can regard this one with the whole process why the honest theorem is correct.

312
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So now we can test the honest theorem with these small numbers.

313
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The first one, n is 10. First we need to calculate 5n.

314
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So this n equals 2 times 5, 2 prime numbers. So 5 equals 1 times 4 is 4.

315
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:44,000
According to the honest theorem, it is A to the 5n, 5 is 4, 1 to 1, mod n.

316
00:44:44,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So A is 3, 3 to the 4, it is 81.

317
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So it is equal to 1 when mod 10.

318
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This is true. We look at the second one.

319
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And this 2 to the 10 mod 11, we know it is 124.

320
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So 124 equals 93 times 11 plus 1.

321
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So this one is 1 to 1.

322
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Okay, well for this honest theorem, actually you can see it is very close to the public key scheme.

323
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,000
A is a vintage, often some operations. We can get back to A itself.

324
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So this is the public key scheme, very close.

325
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So we skip our break. So let's try to finish our part 4.

326
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Part 4 talks about how we can apply very efficient model operations for very large numbers.

327
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And then we can apply the CRT, the Chinese Remainder Theorem. So what are the purposes for this one?

328
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells you that

329
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Given we have a very large number of exponential operations mod some prime numbers,

330
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:36,000
we can have this quick way to decide the result.

331
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The reason is because in the RSA algorithm, we need to calculate the message to public key mod a given number n.

332
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And this n can be factor to be two prime numbers in the key.

333
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
In RSA algorithm, we will show two big prime numbers in the key.

334
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So e is a given public key. So normally we need to do this kind of calculation.

335
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:32,000
However, because n is very large, we can first calculate m e, m to the e is also very large.

336
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But once we have this m e mod p, we get some R1 value.

337
00:48:43,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So these two values will be much easier to calculate compared to any mod n because both p and t are much smaller.

338
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So the Chinese Remainder Theorem tells you that from these two equations, we get a unique number x, a unique x.

339
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
To be smaller than n, we can decide the result.

340
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So CRT, this theorem can tell you that we can calculate this thing.

341
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And this thing in fact equals the original big number m to the e mod n.

342
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Rather than to calculate m e mod s to the e, we can calculate m e mod t and m e mod 2.

343
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:58,000
From two Remainders, we will calculate the CRT algorithm. We can quickly get x like here.

344
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So that's the purpose we will calculate the CRT from this operation here.

345
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
To make your calculation to be four times faster than the original calculation.

346
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Okay, so this is the purpose.

347
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Now we look at what's the meaning for Chinese Remainder Theorem.

348
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And this one is believed to have been discovered by the Chinese mathematician Shen Tzu.

349
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:39,000
In a round 100 AD, and this one is one of the most useful results of number theory,

350
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:54,000
it says that it is possible to reconstruct integers in a certain range from their residue modular or set of pairwise vector prime modular lines.

351
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Okay, you know the story, right?

352
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So now you don't know the number, but you count a group of items, 3 by 3, then the net is 2.

353
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You count all the numbers 5 by 5, because you divide the numbers by 5, the remainder is 3.

354
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You count them by 7, the net remainder will be 2.

355
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The question is, what's the original number of items here?

356
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So you can find this story in the She Diao Yin Cong Zhuo, used by Jin Yong to test how smart you are.

357
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Okay, we can have a formal definition of this theory.

358
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Then n1, n sub 1, n sub 2 sub k, the integers written on 1, we call them to be modular or divisors.

359
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And this is denoted by n, the product of the ni.

360
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So n is n1, n sub 1 times n sub 2 times n sub k.

361
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The Chinese remainder theorem asserts that if the ni or pairwise co-prime,

362
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:46,000
so pairwise co-prime, that means just like GCD, ni, nj is 1.

363
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And n2, the greatest common divider is 1.

364
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And if n1, n sub 1, n sub k are integers, but that will kill the ai in this range for every i, then there is only one integer x.

365
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So we have this x in this range, and the remainder of the Euclidean division of x by ni is ai for every i.

366
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:33,000
In other words, this x, well, mod ni, we have a1, and the mod nk, we have ak.

367
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So from all these k equations, we say we have a unique x.

368
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So this x is smaller than n, non-negative.

369
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Next, divided by n sub 1, the remainder is a1.

370
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Finally, we have this k equations.

371
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The Chinese remainder theorem tells you that we have a unique x in this range, 1x, to stand by all k equations.

372
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So one example here is suppose x, according to previous problem, we count x by 3, the left is 2.

373
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We count all x by 5, the left is 3, we count x by 7, so divide it by 7, 7 by 7, 7 as a group.

374
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The remainder is 2, what's the original x?

375
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So we have 3 propositions, p1, p2, p3.

376
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:18,000
From proposition 1, of course, from this one, we have, easily we can get x equals 3 times t plus 2.

377
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,000
3 times 3 times 2.

378
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So from proposition 1, we have this one.

379
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,000
From this, well, if x equals this value, we use the second proposition.

380
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:56,000
So second proposition means 3t plus 2, when we mod 5, so we mod 5, this is congruent to 3.

381
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So from proposition 2, this means, well, x mod 5 equals 3.

382
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So this implies before 2, both sides, we have minus 2.

383
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So 3t is congruent to 3 minus 2, mod 5.

384
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So we have this one equation, 3t is congruent to 1, mod 5.

385
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
This is the result of the second proposition.

386
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So what is the mod 5 operation? If t, we look at t.

387
00:56:42,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So t value can be anyone from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

388
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Because it is mod 5, we don't need to use t to define mod 5 because we have a loop.

389
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:17,000
If t is 0, mod 5 is 0. 3t is 0. 3t mod 5 is 0, right?

390
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:27,000
If t is 1, 3t is, what's the value?

391
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What's the value? 3. 3t mod 5 is 3.

392
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:44,000
If t is 2, 3t is 1. 6. 3t mod 5 is 1.

393
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:56,000
t is 3, 3t is 9, mod 5, 4. 4, 3t, 12.

394
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
2, right? If t is 5, beyond 0.

395
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Okay, we have the result 3t mod 5 is 1.

396
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:24,000
That means this row. So this implies t mod 5 should be 2.

397
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:33,000
t mod 5 should be 2. t mod 5 can be 1 times 0 times 1 times 2 times 3 times 4.

398
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So only if t is 2, then 3t will be 1.

399
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So we have this equation 4. t can be represented as 1.

400
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So t can be represented as 5s plus 2.

401
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Mod 5 equals 2. 5s equals 2.

402
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So that means from both P1 and P2, we have this x.

403
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We have x equals 3t plus 2.

404
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And this t, 5s plus 2, to substitute this t, we have 3 times 5s plus 2 plus 2.

405
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
So we have 15s plus 8.

406
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:41,000
From proposition P1 and proposition 2, we have the conclusion

407
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:54,000
x can be represented as 15s plus 8.

408
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Is that clear?

409
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:07,000
If we only have two propositions, so we can say the original x can be 8.

410
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
If we only have one proposition, we can say we count the items.

411
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:24,000
If only this condition, the original number of items can be what? 2, right?

412
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Just two items. We count them by 3, we leave it 2. So 2 is the correct answer.

413
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So now suppose we have two propositions. We count them 5 by 5.

414
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
So that is 3. Then we have the answer.

415
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
The original items can be 8.

416
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So A satisfied proposition 1 in order of proposition 2.

417
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But we have three conditions, three constraints. So we need to continue.

418
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Now we look at proposition 3.

419
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,000
So because x is 15s plus 1, we take mod 7 operation.

420
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Mod 7, so this is actually can be represented as 14s plus 7 plus 1.

421
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
We convert to mod 7.

422
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
So 14s mod 7 is 0. This is 0.

423
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:46,000
And we have s plus 1, s plus 1, convert to 2, mod 7.

424
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So this one implies s mod 7 equals 1.

425
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
S mod 7 equals 1. So s plus 1 mod 7 equals 2.

426
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
For us, we mod 1, we get this equation.

427
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So s mod 7 equals 1.

428
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Then we have s can be represented as 7 times u plus 1.

429
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So this s, we can substitute s to be here.

430
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Then finally we have x to be 105 times u plus 23.

431
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So s equals 7u plus 1.

432
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
We look at x, that equation.

433
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Substitute s by 7u plus 1, so we have x equals 105 times u plus 23.

434
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And this is the general form to represent the value of x.

435
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And note that 105 is a deep common model of 357.

436
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
357 or the modular here. 357.

437
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So then we have a solution 23, 128, 233.

438
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Model of 105.

439
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:28,000
However, in this range, 3 times 5.

440
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
3 times 5 times 7, this equals 5.

441
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,000
We have a unique x to be 23.

442
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So of course, the original number according to that counting is not unique.

443
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
We have 23, 128.

444
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But to be smaller than that, 105, we have a unique value to be 23.

445
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
This is the problem.

446
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Okay, now we have this exercise.

447
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Suppose x plus 5 is 3.

448
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
x plus 7 is 4.

449
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
What's x?

450
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I give you 5 minutes.

451
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Anyone can provide the correct answer.

452
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Then you can eat. Otherwise, they eat.

453
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So tell me.

454
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
What's x? Tell me.

455
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
What's x?

456
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
What's x?

457
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
What's x?

458
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
What's x?

459
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
What's x?

460
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
What's x?

461
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
What's x?

462
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
What's x?

463
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
What's x?

464
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
What's x?

465
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
What's x?

466
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
What's x?

467
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
What's x?

468
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
What's x?

469
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
What's x?

470
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
What's x?

471
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
What's x?
