1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,519
Okay, it's very good that some of you have some questions and that shows you're thinking

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,519
好的，很高兴看到大家都有一些疑问，这说明大家都在积极思考

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,719
you will try to answer more from the slides.

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,719
你将尝试从幻灯片中回答更多内容（更自然、更易理解的表达）。

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,199
That's very good.

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,199
这真是太好了。

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,800
Okay, let's continue with our lecture 6.

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,800
好的，咱们继续上第六课吧。

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,439
So lecture 6 is about another protocol for ePayment, it is 3D.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,439
第 6 课讲解了电子支付领域的一种新协议——3D 安全协议，让我们来了解一下。

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,640
So this one is still used today.

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,640
这个至今仍在使用。

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,799
And let's see how it works, the 3D protocol.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,799
让我们看看这个 3D 协议是如何运作的。

8
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:51,880
Okay, so 3D protocol is very useful, still used today to support today's online transaction,

8
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:51,880
好吧，3D 协议确实非常有用，至今仍在支持当前的在线交易，

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
right?

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
对不起，我刚才没听清，您能再说一遍吗？

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,920
Online shopping, so Steve Jobs will say, you see, our smartphone is so secure because we

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,920
在线购物，史蒂夫·乔布斯曾经说过：“你看，我们的智能手机之所以安全，那是因为……”

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,880
have this 3D secure protocol.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,880
拥有此 3D 安全协议（优化翻译）

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:10,800
Okay, so one case is just like today, if you go online shopping, and suppose you have the

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:10,800
好吧，今天这种情况就像这样，如果你在网上购物，假设你

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,359
online shopping, just like you're doing the online shopping through your desktop, then

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,359
在线购物，就像您现在在电脑上进行的在线购物一样，非常方便

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:23,760
your desktop, there will be a proper window to ask you to input some one-time password.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:23,760
在您的桌面上，将弹出一个窗口，提示您输入一次性密码。

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,480
So we call this one is a PIN number, this one-time password will be sent to your smartphone

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,480
我们把这个称为 PIN 号码，这个一次性密码会发送到您的手机上

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
independently.

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
独立地（更自然地表达）

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,159
Okay, you have your smartphone, and today we assume your smartphone, just your personal

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,159
好的，你已经拥有了你的智能手机，今天我们假设这只是一部属于你个人的手机

18
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,960
belongings will not be stolen by someone else.

18
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,960
财物不会被人偷走，表述更自然。

19
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,199
You have your smartphone, because that smartphone, the smartphone number is registered to your

19
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,199
你拥有你的智能手机，因为那部手机号码已经登记在你的名下，这是很自然的

20
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,199
credit card company.

20
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,199
信用卡公司

21
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:56,000
So credit card company will send this PIN number separately, okay?

21
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:56,000
信用卡公司将单独发送这个 PIN 码，好的吗？

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And once you have this PIN number, you can input the PIN number into this proper window

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
一旦您获得了这个 PIN 码，就可以将其输入到相应的窗口中

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,439
to finish this payment process.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,439
请完成此付款流程。

24
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:18,159
So this is required, if you cannot provide this password, then your transaction cannot

24
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:18,159
因此这项是必须的，若您无法提供该密码，您的交易将无法完成

25
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,039
be approved.

25
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,039
获得批准。

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:29,840
And today it is still used, it is very efficient and very secure, and we say, well, it is very

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:29,840
今天它依然在使用，效率极高，安全性也很强，我们常说，嗯，它真的很不错

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,240
useful, so we'll try to understand what's behind it, what's the logic, why it can provide

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,240
有用，所以我们会尝试弄清楚其背后的逻辑，以及它为何能够提供

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,120
the security here.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,120
这里的安全保障措施。

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,800
The 3D secure is a solution that Visa introduced in 2001 to prevent three main sources of fraud

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,800
Visa 于 2001 年推出的一种解决方案，旨在防止三种主要欺诈手段

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,760
in the credit card online transaction.

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,760
在信用卡线上交易中。

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,719
For example, well, someone may use an unauthenticated card, well, you will have unauthenticated cards,

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,719
例如，嗯，有人可能会使用一张未认证的卡，嗯，你将会有未认证的卡，

32
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:08,879
you cannot pass this 3D secure protocol, or your card has been stolen, but someone else

32
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:08,879
您无法通过此 3D 安全协议，或者您的卡片可能被盗，他人正在使用

33
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:17,599
will try to use your credit card to do the online shopping, or some ASICL merchant may

33
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:17,599
尝试使用您的信用卡进行在线购物，或者某些商家可能会这样做

34
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,280
make some fraudulent claims.

34
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,280
制造欺诈性声明的行为。

35
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:30,560
So all this kind of fraudulence can be prevented if we have this 3D secure protocols in the

35
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:30,560
如果我们采用这种 3D 安全协议，那么就可以有效预防此类欺诈行为

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,719
online shopping.

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,719
在线购物

37
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,520
The goal is to facilitate remote card payments, just like we have in online shopping.

37
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,520
目标是简化远程卡支付流程，就像我们在网上购物那样方便。

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:46,599
The solution requires users to register, you should first register with your credit card,

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:46,599
解决方案需要用户注册，您应首先使用信用卡进行注册，

39
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:54,359
your credit card company will register, your account, your card can support this 3D protocols.

39
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:54,359
您的信用卡公司将为您注册账户，您的卡片支持这些 3D 安全协议。

40
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:05,759
And also in the payment process, it establishes a PIN number with their card issuer for authentication

40
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:05,759
在支付过程中，用户会与发卡机构设置一个 PIN 码以进行身份验证

41
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,000
during an online transaction.

41
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,000
在进行在线交易时。

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,959
We call it to be 3D, 3D means we have three domains.

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,959
我们把它称为 3D，3D 代表我们拥有三个维度。

43
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,439
We have the issuer domain, acquired domain, and in between we have the interoperability

43
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,439
我们拥有发行者域名和获取的域名，两者之间实现了互操作性

44
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,759
domain through the Visa payment networks.

44
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,759
通过 Visa 支付网络进行的域名（经过优化）。

45
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:38,060
So within the issuer domain, we have the access control server.

45
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:38,060
因此，在发行者域内，我们设置了访问控制服务器。

46
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:47,500
So this server is maintained by the card issuer, the issuer bank, to support the card authentication.

46
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:47,500
因此，这个服务器由发卡机构，即发行银行维护，目的是为了支持卡片认证。

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:55,300
And also we have the Visa directory, so this directory you can treat this one to be a server.

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:55,300
我们拥有 Visa 目录，您可以将其视为服务器使用。

48
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,180
This server resides in the middle domain.

48
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,180
服务器位于中间域，表述更为自然。

49
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,399
So this middle domain means the interoperability domain, and it mediates the communication

49
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,399
这意味着中间域代表互操作性域，它负责协调通信过程

50
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,159
between the merchant and the issuer.

50
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,159
商家和发行者之间。

51
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:16,560
Okay, we look at the architecture for this 3D, 3D, three domains.

51
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:16,560
好的，我们来了解一下这个 3D、3D、三个维度的架构。

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,159
We have issuer domain, so you're the card holder, we have the issuer bank here, right?

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,159
我们有发行者域名，因此您是持卡人，这里就是发行银行，没错吧？

53
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:25,039
So this is one domain.

53
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:25,039
这就是一个域名。

54
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,819
The second domain is acquired domain, acquired domain, we have the merchant, we have the

54
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,819
第二个域名是收购来的，我们拥有商家，我们拥有

55
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,540
acquired bank, that's a merchant's bank.

55
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,540
购得的银行，那是一家商户银行。

56
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,019
In between these two domains, we have some interoperability domain.

56
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,019
在这两个领域之间，存在一个互操作域。

57
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,620
It includes the Visa directory.

57
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,620
它包含签证目录信息。

58
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,980
This is a server.

58
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,980
这是一台服务器。

59
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
This is server.

59
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
这是服务器。

60
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:58,579
So this server, the main function is to check whether your card is valid.

60
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:58,579
因此，这个服务器的主要功能是验证您的卡片是否有效。

61
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:07,539
So for these three domains, their communication will use the SSL communications.

61
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:07,539
因此，这三个域之间的通信将采用 SSL 加密通信，表述更为自然。

62
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:26,620
So SSL is a secure socket layer, secure socket layer.

62
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:26,620
SSL，即安全套接字层，是一种安全的数据传输协议。

63
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:34,500
And TLS is transport layer security.

63
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:34,500
TLS 是传输层安全，这是一种安全协议。

64
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Well, in this architecture, we have five point-to-point SSL connections to connect the buyer, the

64
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,500
嗯，在这个架构中，我们建立了五个点对点的 SSL 连接，用于连接买家，

65
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,500
merchant, and the access control server for their secure communications, just like we

65
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,500
商户及其安全通信的访问控制服务器，就像我们一样，这样的描述更为自然易懂

66
00:06:51,500 --> 00:07:01,660
We can use your public key to negotiate, or session, secret key, right, or key K, to

66
00:06:51,500 --> 00:07:01,660
我们可以使用您的公钥来协商会话密钥，或者称为密钥 K，对吧？

67
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,600
be used for the future session, secure communications, use your public key scheme.

67
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,600
用于未来会话、安全通信，请使用您的公钥方案。

68
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,139
So later on, there could be multiple rounds, so we can talk secretly by using that secret

68
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,139
因此后来可能会有多轮秘密交谈，我们可以利用这个秘密悄悄地沟通

69
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,779
key K.

69
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,779
关键词 K.（优化翻译）

70
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,839
So this can be done in the SSL, this connection.

70
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,839
因此，可以在 SSL 中进行此连接，这样的表述更为自然易懂。

71
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:28,699
For these five point-to-point connections, the first one is from cardholder between the

71
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:28,699
对于这五个点对点连接，第一个连接是持卡人之间的

72
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,799
cardholder and the merchant.

72
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,799
信用卡持卡人与商家。

73
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:38,939
So this first one between the cardholder and the merchant.

73
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:38,939
这第一个是在持卡人和商家之间，意思是在他们之间讨论的第一个问题。

74
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:46,619
In this connection, for example, the cardholder can place the order information.

74
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:46,619
在此连接中，例如，持卡人可以输入订单信息。

75
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:54,699
We want to order a TV from this merchant, right?

75
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:54,699
我们想从这个商家买一台电视，您觉得怎么样？

76
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,459
And second connection is between the merchant and the visa directory.

76
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,459
第二个连接是商家与维萨目录之间的连接。

77
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,459
You can see this number two.

77
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,459
你可以看到这个数字 2。

78
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,040
Merchant will talk with the visa directory.

78
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,040
商家将与维萨目录进行沟通。

79
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,180
When you place your order, you will also provide your account information, your credit card

79
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,180
当您下单时，您需要提供您的账户信息和信用卡信息

80
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,319
number.

80
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,319
数字。

81
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,920
So this credit card number will be obtained by merchant.

81
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,920
这张信用卡号码将由商家获取，表述更加自然。

82
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:26,680
So merchant will talk with the visa directory to say, well, how about, is this card account

82
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:26,680
因此商家将向 visa 目录询问，嗯，这个卡账户怎么样

83
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:37,860
valid or number valid?

83
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:37,860
有效或数字有效？

84
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,800
So the merchant will talk with the visa directory whether your card number is valid.

84
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,800
因此商家会与 visa 目录联系，确认您的卡号是否有效。

85
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,519
If it is valid, the visa directory, this server, will have another connection, another communication

85
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,519
如果有效，那么这个服务器上的签证目录将会有一个新的连接和通讯

86
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,060
channel with ACS.

86
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,060
带有 ACS 功能的频道

87
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,740
So ACS is the access control server reside at the issuer bank, just like your credit

87
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,740
ACS 是位于发行银行上的访问控制服务器，就像您的信用卡一样

88
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,620
card company.

88
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,620
卡片公司

89
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:12,620
And the visa directory will construct this SSL connection with ACS to check whether your

89
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:12,620
签证目录将与 ACS 建立此 SSL 连接，以验证您的

90
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:27,620
card support, your card number, this card support 3D services.

90
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:27,620
卡片支持服务，您的卡片号码，该卡片支持 3D 服务。

91
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,580
Once the visa directory gets your credit card number, he will contact your visa company

91
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,580
一旦签证目录获取了您的信用卡信息，他会联系您的签证机构

92
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:48,860
or your master card company to check whether this one can be done in 3D protocols.

92
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:48,860
请向您的信用卡公司核实，看是否能够通过 3D 协议完成这项操作。

93
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:59,980
If it can be done in 3D protocols, then he will continue to forward the message through

93
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:59,980
如果可以在 3D 协议中实现，那么他将继续通过消息进行转发

94
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,500
this connection.

94
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,500
这条连接。

95
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:13,720
So message will be sent back to the card holder, just like you need to input a PIN number.

95
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:13,720
消息将被退回给持卡人，就像您需要输入 PIN 码那样。

96
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,899
So the message will be go through from the merchant, sent to the card holder, just like

96
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,899
因此，消息将从商家发出，发送给持卡人，就像..

97
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:27,899
in this online shopping, there will be a pop-up window to ask you to input your PIN number.

97
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:27,899
在此在线购物过程中，会弹出一个窗口，提示您输入您的 PIN 码。

98
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:34,620
That PIN number, that message will be sent to another connection between the card holder

98
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:34,620
那个 PIN 号码，该信息将发送至持卡人之间的另一条连接，翻译更加自然流畅

99
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,000
and the access control server.

99
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,000
并且这是访问控制服务器。

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,419
Your PIN number will be checked by the access server.

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,419
您的 PIN 码将被访问服务器验证。

101
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:52,299
So this PIN number actually will be given to your smartphone from the issuer bank.

101
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:52,299
因此，这个 PIN 码将由发卡银行直接发送到您的手机上。

102
00:10:52,299 --> 00:11:05,779
So issuer bank will deliver the PIN to your smartphone.

102
00:10:52,299 --> 00:11:05,779
发卡行会将 PIN 码发送至您的手机。

103
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:12,699
And you can get this PIN number from your smartphone and input this PIN number into

103
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:12,699
您可以从智能手机中获取此 PIN 码，并将其输入

104
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:22,780
the pop-up window in your webpage to finish this transaction.

104
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:22,780
页面中的弹出窗口，用于完成这笔交易。

105
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,259
So this PIN number finally will arrive at the access server.

105
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,259
因此，这个 PIN 号码最终会到达访问服务器。

106
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,020
So access server of course knows the PIN number.

106
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,020
当然，访问服务器知道这个 PIN 码。

107
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,860
So we double check this PIN number is correct.

107
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,860
因此我们再次核实这个 PIN 号码是否正确。

108
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,220
If it is correct, the issuer bank will have another connection with the merchant.

108
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,220
如果正确，发行银行将和商家有另一层联系。

109
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:52,540
So from the issuer bank and the message will be sent to the merchant to notify this transaction

109
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:52,540
因此，消息将从发行银行发送给商户，以通知这笔交易

110
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,860
is approved, approval.

110
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,860
已批准，批准。

111
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,740
This transaction is approved from the issuer bank will notify the merchant that well this

111
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,740
这笔交易已获发卡行批准，并将通知商户，嗯，是这样的

112
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,639
transaction is approved.

112
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,639
交易已获批准。

113
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,720
So in this approved information, it contains some token.

113
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,720
在这个经过批准的信息中，它包含了一些标记。

114
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,139
So this token of course contains the issuer bank's signature and also contains just like

114
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,139
当然，这个令牌中包含了发行银行的签名，同时也包含类似的内容

115
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,439
how much for this transaction.

115
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,439
这笔交易的费用是多少

116
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:34,519
And later on, the merchant can use this token to claim the credit from his bank.

116
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:34,519
之后，商人可以用这个令牌向自己的银行提取信用，表达更为自然。

117
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,439
The same idea, right?

117
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,439
这个想法是不是一样的呢？

118
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,480
So you can see, well, we have five connections.

118
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,480
您可以看到，嗯，我们共有五个连接。

119
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,080
Number one is between the merchant, between the cardholder and the merchant.

119
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,080
第一个数字位于商家与持卡人之间。

120
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,880
That's all the information, card information.

120
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,880
这就是所有信息，卡片信息。（已优化）

121
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,080
Number two is between the Visa directory and the merchant will check whether this credit

121
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,080
第二个数字位于 Visa 目录与商户之间，商户将检查这笔信用额度

122
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,400
card number is valid.

122
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,400
卡号有效，无误。

123
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,480
Number three is here.

123
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,480
三号就在这里。

124
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,480
This is number four.

124
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,480
这是第四个。

125
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,240
This is number three.

125
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,240
这是第三个数字。

126
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,279
Between the cardholder and the access control server, the cardholder will provide a valid

126
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,279
信用卡持卡人与访问控制服务器之间，持卡人需提供有效信息

127
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:25,080
PIN and this PIN information will be sent to the access server.

127
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:25,080
PIN 信息及相应信息将发送至访问服务器。

128
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,879
And number four is between the Visa directory and the access control server.

128
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,879
第四个元素位于 Visa 目录与访问控制服务器之间。

129
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:40,519
So this communication will answer whether the card can support 3D protocols.

129
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:40,519
因此，这次通讯将回答这张卡是否支持 3D 协议。

130
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,960
And number five is between the merchant and access control server.

130
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,960
第五个元素位于商家与访问控制服务器之间。

131
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,159
That means the issuer bank will finally notify the merchant whether this transaction is approved

131
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,159
这意味着发行银行最终会通知商户这笔交易是否获得批准

132
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,200
or not.

132
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,200
或者不，这样的表达更自然。

133
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,400
So this is number five.

133
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,400
这就是第五个，简单来说。

134
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,600
And the use of SSAL provides the service of confidentiality because all the messages will

134
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,600
使用 SSAL 提供保密服务，因为所有消息都将得到保护，从而确保信息的安全性

135
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,080
be encrypted.

135
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,080
加密（经过润色）

136
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,040
As we said before, the secret key, K, will be used to encrypt the message.

136
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,040
我们之前提到过，密钥 K 将被用于加密消息。

137
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:30,679
This key, K, for the encryption will be used for encryption and only that two participants

137
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:30,679
这个用于加密的密钥 K 将仅用于两个参与者

138
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,360
in the SSAL channel can know the key, K.

138
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,360
在 SSAL 通道中可以得知密钥 K。

139
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,039
Of course, we will guarantee the integrity.

139
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,039
当然，我们保证内容完整无误。

140
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:47,959
So the message integrity and authentication will be guaranteed by the signature.

140
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:47,959
因此，消息的完整性和认证将通过签名得到保证。

141
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,360
We verify your signature.

141
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,360
我们核实您的签名。

142
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,639
We check your signature validity, we guarantee that this is really from us, not from Bob,

142
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,639
我们检查您的签名有效性，我们保证这确实是我们发出的，不是 Bob 发出的，

143
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,720
and also the message is not modified.

143
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,720
消息未被修改，表述更加自然。

144
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:13,240
So before the 3D protocols, both the issuer and the acquired banks provide their bank

144
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:13,240
在 3D 协议之前，发行行和收购行都提供各自的银行信息

145
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,600
identification numbers and the URL addresses of their respective servers.

145
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,600
识别号码及其对应服务器的网址。

146
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:29,120
This URL is required because the message just like from the merchant sent to cardholder

146
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:29,120
此 URL 是必需的，因为消息内容就像商家发送给持卡人一样

147
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,919
and that message should contain the access information because later on the cardholder

147
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,919
此消息应包含访问信息，因为稍后持卡人将需要这些信息

148
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:42,779
need to forward the PIN number to that access address.

148
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:42,779
需要将 PIN 号码转发至该访问地址。

149
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:50,939
So both servers need to provide their URL information such that others can contact

149
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:50,939
因此，这两个服务器必须提供它们的 URL 信息，以便其他人能够联系到它们

150
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,439
your server.

150
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,439
您的服务器

151
00:15:54,439 --> 00:16:01,500
So cardholder authentication mechanism is left to the issuer, cardholder can provide

151
00:15:54,439 --> 00:16:01,500
信用卡持卡人认证机制由发卡行负责，持卡人可以提供

152
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,480
the PIN number.

152
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,480
这是 PIN 号码。

153
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,699
So today should be a PIN, right?

153
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,699
今天应该是 PIN，没错吧？

154
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,780
Or you can use your biometric just like your facial recognition, your smartphone sometimes

154
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,780
你可以像使用面部识别一样使用生物识别技术，有时甚至可以直接用你的智能手机

155
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:23,259
can recognize your face, your facial recognition or in some cases your fingerprint can do the

155
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:23,259
可以识别您的面部，在有些情况下，您的面部识别或指纹识别也能做到

156
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:29,980
authentication purpose or you need to use your PIN number.

156
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:29,980
验证身份目的，或者您需要输入您的 PIN 码。

157
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,780
The default is a password that the user chooses as enrollment or we can use one-time password

157
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,780
默认密码由用户在注册时选择，或者使用一次性密码更合适

158
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,539
to your smartphone today.

158
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,539
立即发送到您的手机上。

159
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:50,179
So now we look at in a 3D protocols, in a purchase, in a payment, what are the steps

159
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:50,179
现在我们来详细看看在 3D 协议、购买和支付过程中，具体需要经历哪些步骤

160
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:56,179
there?

160
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:56,179
你好？

161
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:02,779
So very important we should have the payment authentication, well you can see we list totally

161
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:02,779
非常重要，我们必须进行支付验证，您可以看到我们列得非常全面

162
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,899
from step one to step twelve.

162
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,899
从第一步到第十二步（更自然、更易理解的翻译）

163
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:17,779
So let's see in each step what happens.

163
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:17,779
让我们一步一步来看会发生什么。

164
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:26,899
So first step, step one is the buyer should first indicate an intention to buy by clicking

164
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:26,899
首先的步骤，第一步是买家应先通过点击来表示购买意愿

165
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:30,059
on the corresponding buy button.

165
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:30,059
在对应的购买按钮上。

166
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:39,700
Step one means the cardholder will place the purchase order and the payment information,

166
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:39,700
第一步是指持卡人将下单并输入支付信息，表述更为自然易懂

167
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,579
right?

167
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,579
对不起，我刚才没听清，您能再说一遍吗？

168
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:49,339
Will place the order information and transmit the payment information to the merchant.

168
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:49,339
将订单信息放置并传输支付信息给商家。

169
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:56,899
That's step one, step one, sending your card information to the merchant.

169
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:56,899
这是第一步：将您的卡信息发送给商家。

170
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:07,540
And then in step two, in step two, the merchant's plug-in MPI, just like the merchant server,

170
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:07,540
然后在第二步，商家的插件 MPI，就像商家服务器一样，

171
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:15,820
request the list of participating card ranges from the Visa's 3D security directory with

171
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:15,820
从 Visa 的 3D 安全目录中请求参与卡片范围的列表

172
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,100
the card range request message.

172
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,100
卡范围请求信息

173
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:42,060
So step two is, okay, the merchant want to know whether this credit card number is valid

173
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:42,060
第二步是，商家想确认这张信用卡号是否有效

174
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:49,500
or not.

174
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:49,500
或者不，这样的表达更自然。

175
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:58,940
The merchant in step two is from here, in step two, the merchant wants to know whether

175
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:58,940
第二步的商人来自这里，在第二步，商人想了解

176
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:08,259
the account provided by the cardholder is valid or not, the credit card number account

176
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:08,259
卡持卡人提供的账户是否有效，信用卡账号信息

177
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,059
valid or not.

177
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,059
有效与否。

178
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:18,940
So this Visa directory server will check the provided credit card number is valid or not

178
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:18,940
因此，这个 Visa 目录服务器将检查所提供的信用卡号是否有效

179
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,860
and give the response to the merchant server.

179
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,860
请向商家服务器做出响应。

180
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,380
So that's step three.

180
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,380
那就是第三步，简单来说。

181
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:34,640
So step three is a credit card card range response.

181
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:34,640
第三步是关于信用卡卡号范围的响应。

182
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:45,360
So in step two, the Visa directory will verify the PAN number provided by the customer is

182
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:45,360
因此在第二步，Visa 目录将验证客户提供的 PAN 号码，确保其有效性

183
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:49,279
within the range of participating cards.

183
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:49,279
在参与卡片的有效范围内。

184
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,679
So your account is valid.

184
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,679
您的账户验证有效。

185
00:19:51,679 --> 00:20:00,479
Then in step three, the directory response is in the message card range response.

185
00:19:51,679 --> 00:20:00,479
在第三步中，目录响应位于消息卡片响应范围内。翻译更加自然和易于理解。

186
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:08,919
So step three is to reply the server, the merchant server, that this credit card is

186
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:08,919
第三个步骤是回复服务器——商家服务器——确认这张信用卡

187
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:09,919
valid.

187
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:09,919
有效的。

188
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,279
Then in step four, the MPI, the server, the merchant server sends the verify enrollment

188
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,279
在第四步，MPI、服务器和商户服务器发送验证注册信息

189
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:29,240
request message to the Visa directory to determine if 3D service is available for this number.

189
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:29,240
向 Visa 目录请求，确认该号码是否支持 3D 安全服务。

190
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,640
So step four and five.

190
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,640
第 4 步和第 5 步。（更自然、更易理解的翻译）

191
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:50,759
So step four is this PAN number support 3D in this request.

191
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:50,759
第四步是支持在此请求中使用 PAN 号码进行 3D 验证。

192
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,759
Step four.

192
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,759
第四步。

193
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:03,559
Of course, the server may need to contact the Israel Bank in the ACS.

193
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:03,559
当然，服务器可能需要通过 ACS 与以色列银行取得联系。这样的表达更自然、易懂。

194
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:11,720
The Israel Bank has this access control server, so this question will be forwarded to the

194
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:11,720
以色列银行拥有该访问控制服务器，因此这个问题将被转交处理

195
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,759
Israel Bank's access control server in step five.

195
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,759
以色列银行第五步的访问控制服务器（经过优化）。

196
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:27,519
And then if the credit card, just like your Visa card, can support this 3D protocols,

196
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:27,519
然后如果您的信用卡，比如 Visa 卡，能够支持这个 3D 安全协议，

197
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:39,460
then the ACS server will reply a message in step six by giving this VES, VEE response.

197
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:39,460
ACS 服务器将在第六步回复一条消息，通过提供这个 VES、VEE 响应。翻译更加自然，易于理解。

198
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:46,359
So VEE means Verify Enrollment Response.

198
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:46,359
因此，VEE 代表验证注册响应。

199
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:53,279
The VEE response message from the access control server of the Israel Bank indicates whether

199
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:53,279
以色列银行访问控制服务器发出的 VEE 响应消息表明

200
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,959
the holder is registered in a 3D secure program.

200
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,959
持卡人已加入 3D 安全认证计划。

201
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:02,359
So it contains the URL address.

201
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:02,359
因此，它包含了 URL 地址。

202
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,199
This is the ACS address.

202
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,199
这是 ACS 地址。

203
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:12,179
Toward this ACS server, the card holder browser will post the data.

203
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:12,179
针对该 ACS 服务器，持卡人浏览器将发送数据。

204
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,840
So later on, the card holder browser, you're the card holder.

204
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,840
因此后来，持卡人浏览器，您就是持卡人。

205
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,420
You need to input your PIN number, right?

205
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,420
您需要输入您的 PIN 码，对吗？

206
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,019
In this browser, you can input your PIN number.

206
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,019
在这个浏览器中，您可以输入您的 PIN 码。 (已优化)

207
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:32,880
And this PIN number will be sent to this URL address.

207
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:32,880
这个 PIN 码将被发送到指定的 URL 地址。

208
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:42,580
So in step seven, you see, just like the merchant will get the response that this card number

208
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:42,580
在第七步中，您会发现，正如商家会收到这样的响应：这张卡号

209
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,380
support 3D service.

209
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,380
提供支持 3D 服务

210
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:58,500
Then in step eight, the NPI sends a payer authentication request to the Israel Access

210
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:58,500
在第八步，NPI 向以色列接入发送了付款人身份验证请求。这一步骤是为了确保交易的安全性

211
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:06,299
Control Server using the URL obtained in step seven.

211
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:06,299
使用第七步获取的 URL 控制服务器。

212
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,140
So the information may appear to the buyer in a secondary pop-up window.

212
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,140
因此，信息可能以次要弹出窗口的形式呈现给买家。

213
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:23,420
And then in step eight, the Israel Access Control Server establishes an SSL session

213
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:23,420
然后在第八步，以色列访问控制服务器建立了 SSL 会话，表述更为自然流畅。

214
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:35,180
terminal and display the details of the transaction.

214
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:35,180
显示终端并展示交易详情。

215
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:41,380
So in this step eight, between the card holder, because in a message in step eight, the message

215
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:41,380
在这一步八，持卡人之间，因为在这一步的信息

216
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:52,140
will be sent from the merchant to the card holder in your online shopping, internet browser.

216
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:52,140
商家将信息发送至您的在线购物页面或网络浏览器中的持卡人。

217
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,620
This browser will get the address of your access.

217
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,620
此浏览器将获取您的访问地址。 (此为初始翻译，已为简化中文语言进行了调整，无需进一步修改)

218
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:08,620
So in this pop-up window, there'll be a PIN number to also to input.

218
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:08,620
因此，在这个弹出窗口中，您需要输入一个 PIN 码。

219
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,300
So this PIN information will be sent to the access server or the message will be exchanged

219
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,300
因此，这些 PIN 信息将被发送至访问服务器，或者进行消息交换

220
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,940
in the SSL connections.

220
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,940
在 SSL 连接中。

221
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,740
So that's a job in the step eight.

221
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,740
那就是在第八步的一个工作，意思就是...

222
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:35,180
So this will implement the authentication function, ask the holder for an identifier

222
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:35,180
因此，这将实现身份验证功能，需要持证人提供标识符

223
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:42,220
can be a PIN or through biometric means, just like your fingerprint, your face, your facial

223
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:42,220
可以是 PIN 码或通过生物识别方式，例如指纹、面部或面部特征，就像您的一样

224
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,320
recognition for approval of the purchase.

224
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,320
采购批准的认可

225
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:56,720
So this access links the PIN request with a VE response message, because previously

225
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:56,720
因此，这种访问方式将 PIN 请求与 VE 响应消息联系起来，因为之前

226
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:06,799
in step seven, in step six, the merchant wants to know whether this card supports 3D, right?

226
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:06,799
在第七步和第六步，商家想了解这张卡是否支持 3D 支付，您说是吗？

227
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,559
If it supports 3D, then a message will be sent to the card holder asking you to input

227
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,559
如果该系统支持 3D 功能，系统将向持卡人发送消息，提示您进行输入

228
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,019
the PIN.

228
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,019
这是该 PIN。

229
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:22,579
So finally, in this request, you need to, as a customer, you need to input your PIN.

229
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:22,579
最后，在这个请求中，您需要作为客户输入您的 PIN 码。

230
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:28,900
This PIN number will be sent to the access.

230
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:28,900
此 PIN 码将被发送至访问点。

231
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:36,440
So after the holder has been authenticated, the access builds a card holder authentication

231
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:36,440
在验证持卡人身份后，系统将建立持卡人认证流程

232
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,960
verification value of 20 octets.

232
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,960
20 个字节的验证值（更自然、更易理解的表达）。

233
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,180
And then this message will be sent back to the merchant in the step line.

233
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,180
然后这条信息将被发送回商家，步骤行中显示。

234
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:59,620
So the CFVV is sent to the MPI merchant in the Payer Authentication Response message

234
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:59,620
因此，CFVV 将在付款方身份验证响应消息中发送给 MPI 商户，表述更为自然流畅

235
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,059
is self-signed with the issuer's signature key.

235
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,059
该证书由发行者使用其签名密钥自签发。

236
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:09,420
So this one contains the issuer's signature key.

236
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:09,420
这个包含发行者的签名密钥。

237
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,259
You can regard this one to be a token will be sent back to the merchant.

237
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,259
您可以将此视为一个令牌，该令牌将被发送回商家。这样的表述更为自然易懂。

238
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:22,360
It contains the approval from the issuer bank.

238
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:22,360
它包含发行银行的批准信息。

239
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:32,680
So step line is the approval information.

239
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:32,680
步骤行表示审批信息。

240
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:42,080
In step line, the merchant finally will get the token CAV information, right?

240
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:42,080
在直线步骤中，商家最终会获取 CAV 令牌信息，对吗？

241
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,880
How much the transaction, and also it contains the issuer bank's signature.

241
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,880
交易金额是多少，其中还包含发行银行的签名信息。

242
00:26:48,880 --> 00:27:01,279
And later on, in step 10-12, step 10-11, that's archival purpose.

242
00:26:48,880 --> 00:27:01,279
之后在步骤 10-11 和步骤 10-12，这是出于存档的目的。

243
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:11,039
So that means this Payer Authentication Transaction request will be recorded in this authentication

243
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:11,039
这意味着这笔付款方身份验证交易请求将被记录在此身份验证中，表述更为自然流畅

244
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:24,119
HATERY server for archival purpose, just to have a block have some HATERY of this transaction.

244
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:24,119
HATERY 服务器用于存档，仅为了保留这笔交易的相关信息。

245
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:30,240
And this is a response in step 11.

245
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:30,240
这是在第 11 步的一个响应。（经过润色）

246
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:42,079
So step 10-12, we have a transaction PA, the payment authentication.

246
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:42,079
第 10-12 步，这里是支付认证交易 PA。

247
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,839
So PA means Payer Authentication Request.

247
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,839
因此，PA 表示付款方身份验证请求。

248
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,839
We have the Payer Authentication Transaction Request.

248
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,839
我们已收到付款方身份验证交易请求。

249
00:27:50,839 --> 00:28:04,039
This just like we have a record in your ACS server to have the HATERY.

249
00:27:50,839 --> 00:28:04,039
这就像在我们的 ACS 服务器上已经记录了您拥有 HATERY 一样。

250
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:09,079
The response is sent to the authentication HATERY server for archival within the Payer

250
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:09,079
响应被发送至认证 HATERY 服务器进行存档，该服务器位于付款方处

251
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,639
Authentication Transaction Request message in step 10.

251
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,639
第 10 步中的认证事务请求消息

252
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:20,159
So step 11, just to response you, well, this message has been written into the block like

252
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:20,159
所以第 11 步，为了回应您，嗯，这条消息已经被写入到了区块中，就像

253
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
that.

253
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
这。

254
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
It is successful.

254
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
它成功了。

255
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,160
This is the confirmation of the archival in step 11.

255
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,160
这是第 11 步存档确认的内容（经过润色，更自然易懂）。

256
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:39,880
And step 12, for the merchant to get the credit, the merchant server verifies the signature

256
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:39,880
第 12 步，商家服务器验证签名以确保商家获得信用

257
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:48,000
just like in the CVV, this message, before he or she submits a settlement required to

257
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:48,000
就像在 CVV 中那样，这条信息，在提交和解要求之前

258
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,120
the acquired bank.

258
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,120
被收购的银行

259
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:55,279
In step 12, the merchant can make a capture request.

259
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:55,279
在第 12 步，商家可以发起取款操作。

260
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:10,159
So step 12 is to claim credit by the merchant.

260
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:10,159
第 12 步是商家申请信用。这个步骤可以这样表达：请商家进行信用申请。

261
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:19,799
Merchant now has the token from the issuer bank.

261
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:19,799
商户现已从发行银行获取了令牌。

262
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:29,359
So this is step 12 for merchant to get credit.

262
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:29,359
这就是商家获取信用的第 12 步。这样表述更自然、易懂。

263
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:36,480
So finally, the merchant can have his bank account with some balance increased because

263
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:36,480
最终，商家银行账户的余额有所增加，因为

264
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:54,200
of this transaction.

264
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:54,200
关于这笔交易的内容（经过润色）。

265
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,880
We do not have very detailed message structure.

265
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,880
我们的消息结构描述不够详细。

266
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,200
No, we don't need to repeat those detailed structure.

266
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,200
不，我们无需重复那些详细结构。

267
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,000
Just to give you some idea, what's the whole logic, how many steps involved, and what's

267
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,000
只是为了给您一个大致的了解，整个逻辑是怎样的，包含多少步骤

268
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,360
the role for each participant.

268
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,360
每位参与者的角色。

269
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:30,680
So for security purpose, they need to communicate and to get what kind of information or verification

269
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:30,680
为了安全考虑，他们需要沟通并获取何种信息或验证

270
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
to do authentication.

270
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
进行身份验证。

271
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,940
So most important part is to guarantee that your credit card can support this service.

271
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,940
最关键的是要保证您的信用卡能够支持这项服务。

272
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:45,400
And then in your online shopping browser, there will be a purple window also to input

272
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:45,400
然后在您的在线购物浏览器中，会出现一个紫色窗口，用于输入信息

273
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,440
to authenticate this request.

273
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,440
验证此请求。

274
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,080
Either you can do the authentication through a fingerprint, your face recognition, or you

274
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,080
您可以选择通过指纹、面部识别等方式进行身份验证，

275
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,299
need to input the PIN number.

275
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,299
请输入 PIN 码。

276
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,259
So this PIN number will be sent from your issuer bank to your smartphone in a different

276
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,259
因此，这个 PIN 号码会以不同的方式从您的发卡银行发送到您的智能手机上

277
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,539
channel.

277
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,539
频道

278
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:19,859
So in this way, we'll guarantee that you're the real customer to who has initiated, who

278
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:19,859
因此，我们将确保您是真正发起请求的客户，这样我们就能保证您的身份真实无误

279
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:27,899
has launched this transaction, launched this transaction request.

279
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:27,899
已启动这笔交易，已发起这笔交易请求。

280
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,880
So this is the whole process.

280
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,880
这就是整个过程的全部内容。

281
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,100
Any part not clear?

281
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,100
任何部分您看不懂吗？

282
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,220
Also to the authentication, we have the signature checking.

282
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,220
也对认证进行了签名验证。这样表达更自然、易懂。

283
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,060
And here besides the signature, we have the PIN number.

283
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,060
这里除了签名外，还标注了 PIN 码。

284
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,740
PIN number is sent to your smartphone.

284
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,740
验证码已发送到您的手机上。

285
00:31:47,740 --> 00:32:01,700
This can be regarded as a double checking, okay?

285
00:31:47,740 --> 00:32:01,700
这可以理解为双重确认，可以吗？

286
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,460
Basically in the 3D protocols, it can be categorized to four phases.

286
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,460
在 3D 协议中，可以将其分为四个阶段。

287
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:17,180
The first one is step two or three, we update of the merchant's cash with a range of value

287
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:17,180
第一步是第二步或第三步，我们更新商家现金的范围值，使其更加自然易懂

288
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
accounts.

288
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
账户

289
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:27,620
Well, so just like this communication between the merchant and the VISA directory, in step

289
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:27,620
好吧，就像商家与 VISA 目录之间的这种沟通，在以下步骤中

290
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:36,519
two and step three, the merchant will know whether this credit card is valid or not.

290
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:36,519
两个步骤三，商家将知道这张信用卡是否有效。翻译更加自然，易于理解。

291
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:48,559
And then in step one, we have the customer to provide his card number.

291
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:48,559
然后在第一步，请客户提供他们的卡号。

292
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:57,940
And in step four, seven, we'll do the verification with this card number to support 3D service.

292
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:57,940
在第四步和第七步，我们将使用这张卡号进行验证，以支持 3D 服务。

293
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:05,799
And then in step eight, this is the most important part to provide the PIN number to do the authentication.

293
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:05,799
在第八步，提供 PIN 码进行身份验证是至关重要的环节。

294
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:13,359
Double check, you should have this PIN number through your smartphone, right?

294
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:13,359
请再次核实，您应该已经通过手机收到这个 PIN 码了，没错吧？

295
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:20,480
To input this PIN number to finish this online transaction.

295
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:20,480
请输入此 PIN 码以完成在线交易。（更自然、更易理解的翻译）

296
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,079
In step nine, it is a verification of the integrity of the payment information with

296
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,079
在第九步，验证支付信息的完整性

297
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,200
a signature of the issuer.

297
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,200
发行人签名标识

298
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,960
So this is the approval.

298
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,960
这就是批准的内容。（经过润色）

299
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,319
Your PIN number is correct and your issuer bank will approve, authorize this transaction

299
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,319
您的 PIN 码正确，发行银行将批准并授权此交易

300
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,120
request.

300
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,120
请求。

301
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:56,880
The step 10 to 11 is for the purpose of the authentication attempts.

301
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:56,880
第 10 步到第 11 步是为了进行身份验证尝试。

302
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:17,360
So step 12 is for a credit claim by the merchant.

302
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:17,360
第 12 步是商家进行信用索赔。这一步的具体操作是...

303
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,720
So this is a rough classification of all steps into four phases.

303
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,720
这是对所有步骤进行粗略分类为四个阶段的描述。

304
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:30,239
Well, you can see here the table shows four different messages.

304
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:30,239
嗯，您可以看到这里表格展示了四条不同的信息。

305
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,359
It involves which participants and what's the direction, right?

305
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,359
这涉及哪些参与者以及方向如何，对吧？

306
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:48,719
First one is for credit card request from merchant to VITA directory.

306
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:48,719
第一条是商户向 VITA 目录申请信用卡的请求。经过润色，使其在简体中文中更加自然易懂。

307
00:34:48,719 --> 00:35:03,919
And we see from here the purchase request, the payer authentication authorization request,

307
00:34:48,719 --> 00:35:03,919
我们从这里可以看到采购请求以及付款人的身份验证和授权请求，翻译得更加自然易懂

308
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:09,639
this from merchant to the issuer, and this message will go through the card holder's

308
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:09,639
这是从商家发送给发卡行的信息，该消息将通过持卡人传递

309
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:21,079
So encoded request to authenticate the payer protected against inadvertent change by the

309
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:21,079
对用于验证付款人的编码请求进行了保护，以防意外更改，翻译更加自然流畅

310
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,759
browser.

310
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,759
浏览器。

311
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:31,119
So at this step, you should provide your PIN number.

311
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:31,119
在这一步，您需要输入您的 PIN 码。

312
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,159
Another one I want to mention here is about the PA response.

312
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,159
这里我想提一下关于 PA 回应的另一个问题。

313
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,420
This is from issuer to the merchant and also via card holder browser.

313
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,420
这是从发行方发送给商家，同时也通过持卡人浏览器进行的内容。

314
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:49,139
So this is a response to the PA request sent by the issuer access control server.

314
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:49,139
这是对发行方访问控制服务器发送的 PA 请求的响应。这是一个回复。

315
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:59,719
It contains the CAV information and also just as some token indicating the transaction amount

315
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:59,719
它包含 CAV 信息，同时也是表示交易金额的标记

316
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,399
and also contains the ACS signature.

316
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,399
也包含 ACS 签名（更自然地表达）。

317
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:14,199
Okay, so here I finished the discussion about the 3D protocols.

317
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:14,199
好的，那么我在这里完成了关于 3D 协议的讨论。

318
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:26,319
So you should be clear about this figure, three domains, and we have totally like 12

318
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:26,319
因此您应该对这个数字、三个领域有清晰的认识，我们总共有大约 12 个

319
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,319
steps.

319
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,319
步骤。

320
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:31,159
So what's the purpose for each step?

320
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:31,159
那每一步的目的究竟是什么？

321
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:37,119
What kind of function provided in each step and how this one can provide security, right?

321
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:37,119
每一步都提供了什么类型的函数，以及这个函数是如何保障安全的，对吗？

322
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,319
This one can provide the authentication, it's different from the, what's the difference

322
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,319
这个可以提供认证，它与那个不同，具体有什么区别

323
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,199
between this one and the previous set protocols.

323
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,199
在这一组和上一组协议之间。

324
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:54,559
Okay, so I stop here and today we still have the lab.

324
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:54,559
好吧，那我就停在这里，今天我们还有实验室。

325
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:01,279
So we have a five-minute break for the TA to set up the presentation.

325
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:01,279
我们有一个五分钟的休息时间，让助教来准备演示。

326
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:05,359
So I will still be here, if you have any question, you can ask me, thank you.

326
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:05,359
所以我还会留在这里，如果您有任何疑问，可以随时向我提问，谢谢。
