1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,519
Okay, it's very good that some of you have some questions and that shows you're thinking

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,719
you will try to answer more from the slides.

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,199
That's very good.

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,800
Okay, let's continue with our lecture 6.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,439
So lecture 6 is about another protocol for ePayment, it is 3D.

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,640
So this one is still used today.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,799
And let's see how it works, the 3D protocol.

8
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:51,880
Okay, so 3D protocol is very useful, still used today to support today's online transaction,

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
right?

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,920
Online shopping, so Steve Jobs will say, you see, our smartphone is so secure because we

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,880
have this 3D secure protocol.

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:10,800
Okay, so one case is just like today, if you go online shopping, and suppose you have the

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,359
online shopping, just like you're doing the online shopping through your desktop, then

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:23,760
your desktop, there will be a proper window to ask you to input some one-time password.

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,480
So we call this one is a PIN number, this one-time password will be sent to your smartphone

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
independently.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,159
Okay, you have your smartphone, and today we assume your smartphone, just your personal

18
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,960
belongings will not be stolen by someone else.

19
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,199
You have your smartphone, because that smartphone, the smartphone number is registered to your

20
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,199
credit card company.

21
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:56,000
So credit card company will send this PIN number separately, okay?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And once you have this PIN number, you can input the PIN number into this proper window

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,439
to finish this payment process.

24
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:18,159
So this is required, if you cannot provide this password, then your transaction cannot

25
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,039
be approved.

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:29,840
And today it is still used, it is very efficient and very secure, and we say, well, it is very

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,240
useful, so we'll try to understand what's behind it, what's the logic, why it can provide

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,120
the security here.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,800
The 3D secure is a solution that Visa introduced in 2001 to prevent three main sources of fraud

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,760
in the credit card online transaction.

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,719
For example, well, someone may use an unauthenticated card, well, you will have unauthenticated cards,

32
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:08,879
you cannot pass this 3D secure protocol, or your card has been stolen, but someone else

33
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:17,599
will try to use your credit card to do the online shopping, or some ASICL merchant may

34
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,280
make some fraudulent claims.

35
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:30,560
So all this kind of fraudulence can be prevented if we have this 3D secure protocols in the

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,719
online shopping.

37
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,520
The goal is to facilitate remote card payments, just like we have in online shopping.

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:46,599
The solution requires users to register, you should first register with your credit card,

39
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:54,359
your credit card company will register, your account, your card can support this 3D protocols.

40
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:05,759
And also in the payment process, it establishes a PIN number with their card issuer for authentication

41
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,000
during an online transaction.

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,959
We call it to be 3D, 3D means we have three domains.

43
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,439
We have the issuer domain, acquired domain, and in between we have the interoperability

44
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,759
domain through the Visa payment networks.

45
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:38,060
So within the issuer domain, we have the access control server.

46
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:47,500
So this server is maintained by the card issuer, the issuer bank, to support the card authentication.

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:55,300
And also we have the Visa directory, so this directory you can treat this one to be a server.

48
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,180
This server resides in the middle domain.

49
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,399
So this middle domain means the interoperability domain, and it mediates the communication

50
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,159
between the merchant and the issuer.

51
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:16,560
Okay, we look at the architecture for this 3D, 3D, three domains.

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,159
We have issuer domain, so you're the card holder, we have the issuer bank here, right?

53
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:25,039
So this is one domain.

54
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,819
The second domain is acquired domain, acquired domain, we have the merchant, we have the

55
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:36,540
acquired bank, that's a merchant's bank.

56
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,019
In between these two domains, we have some interoperability domain.

57
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,620
It includes the Visa directory.

58
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,980
This is a server.

59
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
This is server.

60
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:58,579
So this server, the main function is to check whether your card is valid.

61
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:07,539
So for these three domains, their communication will use the SSL communications.

62
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:26,620
So SSL is a secure socket layer, secure socket layer.

63
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:34,500
And TLS is transport layer security.

64
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Well, in this architecture, we have five point-to-point SSL connections to connect the buyer, the

65
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,500
merchant, and the access control server for their secure communications, just like we

66
00:06:51,500 --> 00:07:01,660
We can use your public key to negotiate, or session, secret key, right, or key K, to

67
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,600
be used for the future session, secure communications, use your public key scheme.

68
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,139
So later on, there could be multiple rounds, so we can talk secretly by using that secret

69
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,779
key K.

70
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,839
So this can be done in the SSL, this connection.

71
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:28,699
For these five point-to-point connections, the first one is from cardholder between the

72
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,799
cardholder and the merchant.

73
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:38,939
So this first one between the cardholder and the merchant.

74
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:46,619
In this connection, for example, the cardholder can place the order information.

75
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:54,699
We want to order a TV from this merchant, right?

76
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,459
And second connection is between the merchant and the visa directory.

77
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:02,459
You can see this number two.

78
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,040
Merchant will talk with the visa directory.

79
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,180
When you place your order, you will also provide your account information, your credit card

80
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,319
number.

81
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,920
So this credit card number will be obtained by merchant.

82
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:26,680
So merchant will talk with the visa directory to say, well, how about, is this card account

83
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:37,860
valid or number valid?

84
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:44,800
So the merchant will talk with the visa directory whether your card number is valid.

85
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,519
If it is valid, the visa directory, this server, will have another connection, another communication

86
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,060
channel with ACS.

87
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,740
So ACS is the access control server reside at the issuer bank, just like your credit

88
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,620
card company.

89
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:12,620
And the visa directory will construct this SSL connection with ACS to check whether your

90
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:27,620
card support, your card number, this card support 3D services.

91
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,580
Once the visa directory gets your credit card number, he will contact your visa company

92
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:48,860
or your master card company to check whether this one can be done in 3D protocols.

93
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:59,980
If it can be done in 3D protocols, then he will continue to forward the message through

94
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,500
this connection.

95
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:13,720
So message will be sent back to the card holder, just like you need to input a PIN number.

96
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,899
So the message will be go through from the merchant, sent to the card holder, just like

97
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:27,899
in this online shopping, there will be a pop-up window to ask you to input your PIN number.

98
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:34,620
That PIN number, that message will be sent to another connection between the card holder

99
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,000
and the access control server.

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,419
Your PIN number will be checked by the access server.

101
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:52,299
So this PIN number actually will be given to your smartphone from the issuer bank.

102
00:10:52,299 --> 00:11:05,779
So issuer bank will deliver the PIN to your smartphone.

103
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:12,699
And you can get this PIN number from your smartphone and input this PIN number into

104
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:22,780
the pop-up window in your webpage to finish this transaction.

105
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,259
So this PIN number finally will arrive at the access server.

106
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,020
So access server of course knows the PIN number.

107
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,860
So we double check this PIN number is correct.

108
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,220
If it is correct, the issuer bank will have another connection with the merchant.

109
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:52,540
So from the issuer bank and the message will be sent to the merchant to notify this transaction

110
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,860
is approved, approval.

111
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,740
This transaction is approved from the issuer bank will notify the merchant that well this

112
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,639
transaction is approved.

113
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,720
So in this approved information, it contains some token.

114
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,139
So this token of course contains the issuer bank's signature and also contains just like

115
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,439
how much for this transaction.

116
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:34,519
And later on, the merchant can use this token to claim the credit from his bank.

117
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,439
The same idea, right?

118
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,480
So you can see, well, we have five connections.

119
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,080
Number one is between the merchant, between the cardholder and the merchant.

120
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,880
That's all the information, card information.

121
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,080
Number two is between the Visa directory and the merchant will check whether this credit

122
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,400
card number is valid.

123
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,480
Number three is here.

124
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,480
This is number four.

125
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,240
This is number three.

126
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,279
Between the cardholder and the access control server, the cardholder will provide a valid

127
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:25,080
PIN and this PIN information will be sent to the access server.

128
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,879
And number four is between the Visa directory and the access control server.

129
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:40,519
So this communication will answer whether the card can support 3D protocols.

130
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,960
And number five is between the merchant and access control server.

131
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,159
That means the issuer bank will finally notify the merchant whether this transaction is approved

132
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,200
or not.

133
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,400
So this is number five.

134
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,600
And the use of SSAL provides the service of confidentiality because all the messages will

135
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,080
be encrypted.

136
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,040
As we said before, the secret key, K, will be used to encrypt the message.

137
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:30,679
This key, K, for the encryption will be used for encryption and only that two participants

138
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,360
in the SSAL channel can know the key, K.

139
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,039
Of course, we will guarantee the integrity.

140
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:47,959
So the message integrity and authentication will be guaranteed by the signature.

141
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,360
We verify your signature.

142
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,639
We check your signature validity, we guarantee that this is really from us, not from Bob,

143
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,720
and also the message is not modified.

144
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:13,240
So before the 3D protocols, both the issuer and the acquired banks provide their bank

145
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,600
identification numbers and the URL addresses of their respective servers.

146
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:29,120
This URL is required because the message just like from the merchant sent to cardholder

147
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,919
and that message should contain the access information because later on the cardholder

148
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:42,779
need to forward the PIN number to that access address.

149
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:50,939
So both servers need to provide their URL information such that others can contact

150
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,439
your server.

151
00:15:54,439 --> 00:16:01,500
So cardholder authentication mechanism is left to the issuer, cardholder can provide

152
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,480
the PIN number.

153
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,699
So today should be a PIN, right?

154
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,780
Or you can use your biometric just like your facial recognition, your smartphone sometimes

155
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:23,259
can recognize your face, your facial recognition or in some cases your fingerprint can do the

156
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:29,980
authentication purpose or you need to use your PIN number.

157
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,780
The default is a password that the user chooses as enrollment or we can use one-time password

158
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,539
to your smartphone today.

159
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:50,179
So now we look at in a 3D protocols, in a purchase, in a payment, what are the steps

160
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:56,179
there?

161
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:02,779
So very important we should have the payment authentication, well you can see we list totally

162
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:07,899
from step one to step twelve.

163
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:17,779
So let's see in each step what happens.

164
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:26,899
So first step, step one is the buyer should first indicate an intention to buy by clicking

165
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:30,059
on the corresponding buy button.

166
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:39,700
Step one means the cardholder will place the purchase order and the payment information,

167
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,579
right?

168
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:49,339
Will place the order information and transmit the payment information to the merchant.

169
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:56,899
That's step one, step one, sending your card information to the merchant.

170
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:07,540
And then in step two, in step two, the merchant's plug-in MPI, just like the merchant server,

171
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:15,820
request the list of participating card ranges from the Visa's 3D security directory with

172
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,100
the card range request message.

173
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:42,060
So step two is, okay, the merchant want to know whether this credit card number is valid

174
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:49,500
or not.

175
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:58,940
The merchant in step two is from here, in step two, the merchant wants to know whether

176
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:08,259
the account provided by the cardholder is valid or not, the credit card number account

177
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:12,059
valid or not.

178
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:18,940
So this Visa directory server will check the provided credit card number is valid or not

179
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,860
and give the response to the merchant server.

180
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,380
So that's step three.

181
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:34,640
So step three is a credit card card range response.

182
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:45,360
So in step two, the Visa directory will verify the PAN number provided by the customer is

183
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:49,279
within the range of participating cards.

184
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,679
So your account is valid.

185
00:19:51,679 --> 00:20:00,479
Then in step three, the directory response is in the message card range response.

186
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:08,919
So step three is to reply the server, the merchant server, that this credit card is

187
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:09,919
valid.

188
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,279
Then in step four, the MPI, the server, the merchant server sends the verify enrollment

189
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:29,240
request message to the Visa directory to determine if 3D service is available for this number.

190
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,640
So step four and five.

191
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:50,759
So step four is this PAN number support 3D in this request.

192
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,759
Step four.

193
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:03,559
Of course, the server may need to contact the Israel Bank in the ACS.

194
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:11,720
The Israel Bank has this access control server, so this question will be forwarded to the

195
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,759
Israel Bank's access control server in step five.

196
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:27,519
And then if the credit card, just like your Visa card, can support this 3D protocols,

197
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:39,460
then the ACS server will reply a message in step six by giving this VES, VEE response.

198
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:46,359
So VEE means Verify Enrollment Response.

199
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:53,279
The VEE response message from the access control server of the Israel Bank indicates whether

200
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,959
the holder is registered in a 3D secure program.

201
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:02,359
So it contains the URL address.

202
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,199
This is the ACS address.

203
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:12,179
Toward this ACS server, the card holder browser will post the data.

204
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,840
So later on, the card holder browser, you're the card holder.

205
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,420
You need to input your PIN number, right?

206
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,019
In this browser, you can input your PIN number.

207
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:32,880
And this PIN number will be sent to this URL address.

208
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:42,580
So in step seven, you see, just like the merchant will get the response that this card number

209
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,380
support 3D service.

210
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:58,500
Then in step eight, the NPI sends a payer authentication request to the Israel Access

211
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:06,299
Control Server using the URL obtained in step seven.

212
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,140
So the information may appear to the buyer in a secondary pop-up window.

213
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:23,420
And then in step eight, the Israel Access Control Server establishes an SSL session

214
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:35,180
terminal and display the details of the transaction.

215
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:41,380
So in this step eight, between the card holder, because in a message in step eight, the message

216
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:52,140
will be sent from the merchant to the card holder in your online shopping, internet browser.

217
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,620
This browser will get the address of your access.

218
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:08,620
So in this pop-up window, there'll be a PIN number to also to input.

219
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,300
So this PIN information will be sent to the access server or the message will be exchanged

220
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,940
in the SSL connections.

221
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,740
So that's a job in the step eight.

222
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:35,180
So this will implement the authentication function, ask the holder for an identifier

223
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:42,220
can be a PIN or through biometric means, just like your fingerprint, your face, your facial

224
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,320
recognition for approval of the purchase.

225
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:56,720
So this access links the PIN request with a VE response message, because previously

226
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:06,799
in step seven, in step six, the merchant wants to know whether this card supports 3D, right?

227
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,559
If it supports 3D, then a message will be sent to the card holder asking you to input

228
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,019
the PIN.

229
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:22,579
So finally, in this request, you need to, as a customer, you need to input your PIN.

230
00:25:22,579 --> 00:25:28,900
This PIN number will be sent to the access.

231
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:36,440
So after the holder has been authenticated, the access builds a card holder authentication

232
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,960
verification value of 20 octets.

233
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,180
And then this message will be sent back to the merchant in the step line.

234
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:59,620
So the CFVV is sent to the MPI merchant in the Payer Authentication Response message

235
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,059
is self-signed with the issuer's signature key.

236
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:09,420
So this one contains the issuer's signature key.

237
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,259
You can regard this one to be a token will be sent back to the merchant.

238
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:22,360
It contains the approval from the issuer bank.

239
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:32,680
So step line is the approval information.

240
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:42,080
In step line, the merchant finally will get the token CAV information, right?

241
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,880
How much the transaction, and also it contains the issuer bank's signature.

242
00:26:48,880 --> 00:27:01,279
And later on, in step 10-12, step 10-11, that's archival purpose.

243
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:11,039
So that means this Payer Authentication Transaction request will be recorded in this authentication

244
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:24,119
HATERY server for archival purpose, just to have a block have some HATERY of this transaction.

245
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:30,240
And this is a response in step 11.

246
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:42,079
So step 10-12, we have a transaction PA, the payment authentication.

247
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,839
So PA means Payer Authentication Request.

248
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,839
We have the Payer Authentication Transaction Request.

249
00:27:50,839 --> 00:28:04,039
This just like we have a record in your ACS server to have the HATERY.

250
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:09,079
The response is sent to the authentication HATERY server for archival within the Payer

251
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,639
Authentication Transaction Request message in step 10.

252
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:20,159
So step 11, just to response you, well, this message has been written into the block like

253
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
that.

254
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
It is successful.

255
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,160
This is the confirmation of the archival in step 11.

256
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:39,880
And step 12, for the merchant to get the credit, the merchant server verifies the signature

257
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:48,000
just like in the CVV, this message, before he or she submits a settlement required to

258
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,120
the acquired bank.

259
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:55,279
In step 12, the merchant can make a capture request.

260
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:10,159
So step 12 is to claim credit by the merchant.

261
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:19,799
Merchant now has the token from the issuer bank.

262
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:29,359
So this is step 12 for merchant to get credit.

263
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:36,480
So finally, the merchant can have his bank account with some balance increased because

264
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:54,200
of this transaction.

265
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,880
We do not have very detailed message structure.

266
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,200
No, we don't need to repeat those detailed structure.

267
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,000
Just to give you some idea, what's the whole logic, how many steps involved, and what's

268
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,360
the role for each participant.

269
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:30,680
So for security purpose, they need to communicate and to get what kind of information or verification

270
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
to do authentication.

271
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,940
So most important part is to guarantee that your credit card can support this service.

272
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:45,400
And then in your online shopping browser, there will be a purple window also to input

273
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,440
to authenticate this request.

274
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,080
Either you can do the authentication through a fingerprint, your face recognition, or you

275
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,299
need to input the PIN number.

276
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,259
So this PIN number will be sent from your issuer bank to your smartphone in a different

277
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,539
channel.

278
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:19,859
So in this way, we'll guarantee that you're the real customer to who has initiated, who

279
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:27,899
has launched this transaction, launched this transaction request.

280
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,880
So this is the whole process.

281
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,100
Any part not clear?

282
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,220
Also to the authentication, we have the signature checking.

283
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,060
And here besides the signature, we have the PIN number.

284
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,740
PIN number is sent to your smartphone.

285
00:31:47,740 --> 00:32:01,700
This can be regarded as a double checking, okay?

286
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,460
Basically in the 3D protocols, it can be categorized to four phases.

287
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:17,180
The first one is step two or three, we update of the merchant's cash with a range of value

288
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
accounts.

289
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:27,620
Well, so just like this communication between the merchant and the VISA directory, in step

290
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:36,519
two and step three, the merchant will know whether this credit card is valid or not.

291
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:48,559
And then in step one, we have the customer to provide his card number.

292
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:57,940
And in step four, seven, we'll do the verification with this card number to support 3D service.

293
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:05,799
And then in step eight, this is the most important part to provide the PIN number to do the authentication.

294
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:13,359
Double check, you should have this PIN number through your smartphone, right?

295
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:20,480
To input this PIN number to finish this online transaction.

296
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,079
In step nine, it is a verification of the integrity of the payment information with

297
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,200
a signature of the issuer.

298
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,960
So this is the approval.

299
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,319
Your PIN number is correct and your issuer bank will approve, authorize this transaction

300
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,120
request.

301
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:56,880
The step 10 to 11 is for the purpose of the authentication attempts.

302
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:17,360
So step 12 is for a credit claim by the merchant.

303
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,720
So this is a rough classification of all steps into four phases.

304
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:30,239
Well, you can see here the table shows four different messages.

305
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,359
It involves which participants and what's the direction, right?

306
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:48,719
First one is for credit card request from merchant to VITA directory.

307
00:34:48,719 --> 00:35:03,919
And we see from here the purchase request, the payer authentication authorization request,

308
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:09,639
this from merchant to the issuer, and this message will go through the card holder's

309
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:21,079
So encoded request to authenticate the payer protected against inadvertent change by the

310
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,759
browser.

311
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:31,119
So at this step, you should provide your PIN number.

312
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,159
Another one I want to mention here is about the PA response.

313
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:42,420
This is from issuer to the merchant and also via card holder browser.

314
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:49,139
So this is a response to the PA request sent by the issuer access control server.

315
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:59,719
It contains the CAV information and also just as some token indicating the transaction amount

316
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,399
and also contains the ACS signature.

317
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:14,199
Okay, so here I finished the discussion about the 3D protocols.

318
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:26,319
So you should be clear about this figure, three domains, and we have totally like 12

319
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,319
steps.

320
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:31,159
So what's the purpose for each step?

321
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:37,119
What kind of function provided in each step and how this one can provide security, right?

322
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,319
This one can provide the authentication, it's different from the, what's the difference

323
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,199
between this one and the previous set protocols.

324
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:54,559
Okay, so I stop here and today we still have the lab.

325
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:01,279
So we have a five-minute break for the TA to set up the presentation.

326
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:05,359
So I will still be here, if you have any question, you can ask me, thank you.
